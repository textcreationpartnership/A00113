            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Than ſayd Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier to the king his father. Syr here I am redye and all my folke for to fulfyll your wyll. Fayre ſonne ſayd Charlemayne I reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god that on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe ſuffred death and paſſion, and hym I beſeche to kepe and waraunt thee &amp; al thy fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawſhyp from euyl &amp; from any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, than departed Lohier and his company, wherof after warde the kynge made great lamentacyon for his ſonne Lohier, and not wyth out a cauſe. For he ſhal neuer ſee hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quicke agayne as ye ſhal vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yf ye wyll kerken it. Now go the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But it ſhal go all other wyſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them.

And thus ridinge &amp; thretynge Benes of Aygremount, a ſpy heard all that they ſayd, and came haſtelye to Aygremo ſit to ward Benes that was in his Palays and tolde hym how meſſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers were coming vnto hym from kyng Charlemayne that ſore thretened him, and that the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of kyng Charlemayne was there in perſon.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke a good knyght that was called ſyr Simon, &amp; ſayd. My lorde I ſhal counſel you truly yf ye wyll herken and beleue me. Receyue honourably the meſſangers of the kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne. For wel ye wote that he is your ryght wyſe lorde, and wit that who y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> warreth againſt his ſouerayn Lorde: he doth agaynſt god &amp; rayſon and haue no regarde to your kynne nor to thys that your bretherne Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarde of Rouſſyllon and the duke of Nantuell wolde not obey hym. For I aduyſe you wel that Charlemayn is myghty, and he ſhall diſtroye you
<pb facs="tcp:7017:8"/> of body and of goodes, but yf that ye obey him. And yf ye amiablie go to hym, he ſhall haue mercy of you. Than anſwered the duke that thus he wolde not doo, and that the ſayd knight gaue him euill counſell. For yet ſayd he I am not ſo low brought but that I haue three brythren that ſhall helpe to ſuſteine and beare out my warre agaynſt Charlemayne, &amp; alſo my foure neuewes the ſonnes of my brother Aymes of Dordon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ben full fayre knightes, worthy and wel taught in faytes of warre. Alas ſayd than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ducheſſe. My good lorde beleue your good counſell. For no men ſhall prayſe you that ye make warre agaynſt your right wyſe lorde, and wit it well that it is agaynſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of God, &amp; againſt all equitie. Wherfore yf ye haue miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doone any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g agaynſt hym, doo ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye be accorded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. And take none heed to your brethern, as ſyr Symon dothe counſell you. For neuer good may come therof for to be euyl in fauoure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſouerayne Lorde. Than behelde the duke the ducheſſe in great wrathe and had her that ſhe ſhould holde her peace in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuilles name, &amp; that ſhe ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more ſpeake to hym of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p>GReat was the noyſe and the bruyte within the palayce of Aygremount, for ſome counſelled the duke, that thus as the ducheſſe ſayd: he ſhould doo, and many other ſayd nay. Than ſayd the duke vnto them that counſelled him naye and that he ſhould not accorde nor make peace with the kyng Charlemayne, that he could theym thanke, muche longe they ſpake of this mater. And the meſſangers of the Kyng Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne duryng the ſame haue riden ſo muche that they ben come to Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremount. And the caſtell was ſee vpon a roche ryght hye and well en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyroned with ſtronge walles thycke highe and wel garnyſhed with great towres, ſo that for the ſtrength and ſytuacyon of the caſtell, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenable, but only by famyſhynge.</p>
            <p>Than ſayd Lohier to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lordes that were wyth hym. Lordes nowe ſee what a fortreſſe is there, what wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les what a ryuer te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth at the foote of it? I beleue verely that in al chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendome is not her lyke. It can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer betake by force, but yf it is by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſhyng. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpake a knight that was called Sauary and ſayd to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier his lorde, ſyr ſayde he it ſemeth me (ſpekynge vnder correccion) that my lorde the kynge Charlemayne your father hath enterpriſed a great foly, whan he troweth to come to at an ende of this duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for in good ſothe he is right puiſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t And I beleue that he ſhall make as mani men for to make the warre, as ſhall my lorde your father yf it cam there to that he wolde make hym warre. It were a fayre thynge yf they myght be accorded together, and of my parte I ſhoulde counſell the ſame yf it myght be doone.</p>
            <p>But well I wot that yf your father
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:7017:8"/> had hym, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> golde in Paris ſhould not kepe hym, but that he ſhould do hange hym or els ſlea hym quycke. So beſeche I you ryght deere ſyr y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſpeake humbly vnto the duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For in certayne he is ryght fyers and outragyous &amp; incontinent might haue there a ſore meddle betwene you and hym, wher of the loſſe ſhould tourne vpon vs. For we ben to lew folke. Than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Lohier and ſayd to hym that he ſayd well and wyſely, but alway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſayd he we doubt hym not of any thynge. We be here al redy an ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred knyghtes well appoynted, and for ſothe yf he ſay vnto vs anye thynge vnto our dyſpleaſure: he ſhalbe the fyrſt that ſhall repent and be ſory for it. Than ſayd the knight Sauare al ſoftly to hymſelf, that this were not wyſely doone. For wel I ſwere ſaid he vpon my fayth that yf it hap you to ſay any thyng to hym that by any maner ſhall diſpleaſe hym: he ſhall make you ſorye and ſhall wreke it vpon you bodye. And happelye we ſhall all be in a waye for to dy. Syr aduyſe your ſelfe well &amp; wyll to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede prudently in your meſſage.</p>
            <p>For well I ſay vnto you that he is ryght cruell, and of greate worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe accomplyſſhed.</p>
            <p>THus ſpekyng of one thyng and of other rode ſo longe the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſangers, that they ben come to the gate of the caſtel which was ſone ſhet by the porter, then knocked the ſayd knightes, and the porter anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to them. Lordes what be you?</p>
            <p>Freende anſwered Lohier open to vs this gate preſently. For we wyll ſpeake to the Duke Benes of Aigre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mount from the kinge Charlemayn Now abyde you a lytle and haſt you not ſayd the porter. And I wyl goe ſpeake redely to my lorde the Duke. So went the ſayde porter into the halle where he ſawe the Duke his lorde. He kneeled incontynent afore him &amp; tolde him howe downe at the gate was a right great company of men of armes. And that they were well an hondred men or more ryght well horſed &amp; well armed, and with them is the eldeſt ſonne of king char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtrongly threteneth you, and alſo your folke. My lorde ſayde the porter ſhall I open the gates vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke For I doubt them nothynge, and we ben ynough for them. And many worthy knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and eſquyers ben no where able for to defende vs all, were Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne himſelf with them with hys puiſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. So ran incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter downe agayne for to open vnto them the gate. Lohier &amp; his felowes entred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in and mounted vp vnto the dongeon of the caſtell where the duke was that ſayd to hys barons. Lordes heere cometh the eldeſt ſonne of the kyng Charlemayne for to tell me his meſſage. But (di y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred death and paſſyon) Yf he ſpeake wyſely to vs he ſhal do as ſage. And yf he ſayth any thyng that ſhall dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe vs, we ſhall ſoone &amp; without delaye take vengeaunce therof. So was the duke Benes well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed &amp; nobly of wel two hondred knyghtes &amp; more. Thys was in the moneth of May that all creatures

And this du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring: Lohier the ſonne of King char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne entred into the halle of the Palays of Aygremount ryght no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly armed and his folke alſo, and ſaw the halle ryght well garnyſhed of fayre folke rychelye arayed. And the duke ſittynge right proudlye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge his barons, and the ducheſſe hys wyfe next by hym, and before hym his ſonne Mawgys that was a great mayſter of the ſcience of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancy that played afore his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his art of nigromancy, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in the Lordes that were there tooke great pleaſure. And wit it well that in all the worlde was not a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyer chryſten, nor more able, than was the ſayd Mawgys. Except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye hys coſyn Reynawde one of the Sonnes of Aymon, wherof ſpecyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treateth now this Hiſtory. Than marched forthe Lohier and wente in the fyrſt of all, and after hym hys folke by good conduyte. And ſalued the duke B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That God that created y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firmament and made all thynge of nought for the people to ſuſteyne. And on the croſſe ſuffred death and paſſyon for all ſoules to be redemed out of the paynes of hel: keep and ſaue the king Charlemay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Emperour of Aimayne and king of Fraunce and all hys noble lyne and confound thee Duke Benes of Aygremounte. My father the kyng by me expreſſely ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to thee word thou come incontinent to Paris w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyue hondred knyghtes for to do to him right and reaſon of thys that thou were not wyth him in armes in the partyes of Lumbardy for to fyght agaynſt the enemyes of the chriſten fayth. Where by thy faute were dead there Bawdoyne lorde of Melanke. Geſfroi of Bourdel, and many other great Dukes Prynces knyghtes and barons. And yf thou wylt not doo it: I tell thee (duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) that the kinge ſhall come vpon thee wyth an hundred thouſand men of armes. So ſhalt thou be take and brought into Fraunce. And there y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſhalt be iudged as a theefe and a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe traytour vnto thy Souerayne Lorde, for to be ſlayne and hanged all quicke, thy wyfe brente and thy chyldren deſtroyed and banyſſhed.</p>
            <p>Doo therfore this that I commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thee in the kinges behalfe, for thou knoweſt well that thou arte his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vaſſayle and ſubiecte.</p>
            <p>WHan the Duke Benes of ay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gremount had heard Lohy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thus ſpeake: Than yf ye had ſene hym chaunged hys coloure pouffe &amp; blowe, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cruel, proude and outrageouſe, and ſayd to Lohier in thys maner. I ſhal not goe to kynge Charlemayne nor nothynge of hys wyll I ſhall not fulfyll. For I hold nother Caſtell ne Fortreſſe of hym, but I ſhall goe vpon him with all my puyſſaunce, and ſhall deſtroy all the lande of Fraunce vnto Parys. Than ſayd Lohier vnto Duke Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="iiii" facs="tcp:7017:9"/> of Aygremount. Vaſſayle ſayde he how dareſt thou anſwere thus?</p>
            <p>And it the king knew now that thou threteneſt hym thus as thou doeſt: he ſhould come incontynent vpon thee, and ſhould vtterli deſtroy thee, well thou knoweſt that thou arte hys liege man, and that thou canne not ſay agaynſt it, come than redely and ſerue thy ſouerayne lorde kinge Charlemyan, and beleue me yf thou wyll ſaue thyne owne lyfe. For if y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> doo it not: I make thee ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yf he can haue thee by force that he ſhall make thee to be hanged there as the ayre and the wyndes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr great blaſtes ſhall dry vp the bones of thee. Whan the duke heard Lohier ſpeake to him in this maner he ſtode vp anon vpon his feete, and ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to his euel chere he cam there for to make to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys meſſage. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came foorth a knyght named ſyr wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter that was a man of the Duke of Aygremount and ſayd to the Duke My lorde keep for gods loue that ye doo no foly. Let Lohier ſay all hys wyll, for ye be neuer the worſe for his ſayenge, and as ye well knowe kynge Charlemayne is ryght puyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſo moche that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſtell, Citie, nor towne neuer ſo ſtronge that can holde agaynſt hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Go than to him by my counſell, for ye be his man his vaſſayle &amp; his ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect, and of hym you holde your caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of Aygremount and all your la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whan the Duke had hearde the wyſe knyght to ſpeake: he coulde to him right good thanke therfore, but alwayes all angry he ſayd to hym, holde your peace. For I ſhall holde nothyng of hym aſlonge that I ſhal may beare armes, and mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te a horſe backe. I ſhall ſende for my deere bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therne Gerrade of Rouſſyllon, and Dron of Natuell, and Garnyer his ſonne, and than we ſhal gone vpon kyng Charlemayne, and yf I canne mete with him in any place: we ſhall deſtroy hym, &amp; ſhall doo of hym that he troweth to doo of me. Wene he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am a cowarde? nay by my faythe, for I ſhould not take all the gold in Parys but that I ſhould ſlea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanger. Euyll was to hym whan he durſt ſo threten me. And than ſayde Lohier, I nether prayſe you nor do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ubt you not. Whan the Duke benes of Agremount vnderſtode Lohyer: he wexed for great wrathe as red as ony fyre in hys face, and began to ryſe vp and to call. Nowe Barons vpon hym, brynge hym to me, for he ſhall neuer be wraunted but that I ſhall make hym to dye ſhamefullye. And the baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s durſt not ſay againſt theyr lorde, but drew al theyr ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. And incontynent did ren vpon Charlemaynes folke. And Lohier called his baner, and than began he and his folke to defende them ſelfe ſharpely. And god knoweth howe many heades and armes were there cut of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day. For at the ſame houre: began a thynge, wherof afterwarde ſo manye ladyes and damoyſelles were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out huſbandes &amp; wythout louers, ſo many of children father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:7017:10"/> and ſo manye chirches waſted and diſtroyed that neuer ſythe were repayred. What ſhal I tel you more? wyt it that they fought there ſo longe wythin the halle of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays: that the noys went through all the towne. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ye haue ſeen the bourgeys, Marchauntes, &amp; men of craft with axes ſwerdes and other wepyns, and came to the Caſtel war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de aboute ſeuen thouſand men and more. But the entre of the Palays of Aygremount was narow, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frenche men were within that kept them well that they entred not in at theyr caſe. Alas what terryble and vnhappy a ſlaughter was there that daye. For the folke of kyng Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne were but a few to the regard of them of the other parte. And as ye may knowe ſuche aſſemble was ryght euyll. So defended them ſelfe moche noblye and valyauntlye the folke of kyng Charlemayne and ſo muche that Lohier ſeynge that, that he and hys folke had the worſe: he ſmote a knight by fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aygremount by ſuche a wyſe that he ouerthrew hym downe dead forth ſayd he gods curſe haue thou, and afterward he ſayd pyteouſly in waylyng himſelfe. Lorde God that within the holy wombe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vyrgyn Marye tooke thy her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowrynge and ſuffred death &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon for to redeme mankynde, wilt defende me thys daye from ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death and from tourment, for I wot well, but yt it be that your hygh diuynitie ſocoure me this day: I ſhall not ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Charlemayne my father no more. Than the Duke called hygh vpon hym ſayenge, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier ſo helpe me God thys day ſhall be your laſte. It ſhall not be ſo ſayde Lohyer. And with this he ſmote the Duke vpon the head, but hys helme ſaued hym. And the ſtroke deſcended to the heele of him ſo that the bloud ranne out. By God ſayd Lohier ye ſhall not eſcape. Than came the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Benes of Aigremount to him as woode and ſore an angred, ſayinge I ſhould prayſe my ſelfe full lytle it I might not auenge me vpon thee. So heaued vp the Duke hys brande of ſteele and ſmote Lohyer ſo harde vpon hys bryght helme that he cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hym to the teeth. And Lohyer fell dead afore hym. vpon the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Halle. Ha God what great domage hath done the Duke Benes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue thus ſlayne Lohier the eldeſt ſonne of the great kyng Charlemayne. Forafter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde al the oſte of Fraunce was in moche great and innumerable tour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente therfore and in ryght greate payne continual, and the Duke him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe dyed therfore, full ſoryly. That was the payment that he had for it, as ye here after ſhall heare yf peaſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ye wyll heare me.</p>
            <p>NOw is outrageouſlye ſlayne the good Lohyer the eldeſt ſonne of kinge Charlemayne And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Benes of Aygremount full of cruelnes tooke the hed from the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy of hym. And after that the folke of the ſayd Lohyer the ſonne of the great kyng Charlemayne ſaw thei. Lorde dead: thynke ye they made no great defence. Alwayes of a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred

They anſwered, Syr wee ſhall doo that, that ſhall pleaſe you to commaunde vs. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Duke dyd doo make redyly a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere, and made the corps of Lohyer to be put wythin the ſayd byere. And after he delyuered it to his .x. knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes that were left on lyue and put it in a carte to drawe wyth two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And the Duke conueyed theym thorough the Towne.

            <p>And there vpon a day kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne ſayd vnto hys Lordes and barons. Lordes I am moch wroch and ſory of my ſonne Lohyer that I haue ſente to Aygremounte, and I feare me ſore that they haue take de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bate wyth the duke Benes of Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte, whiche is fell, and cruell, &amp; I doubte me leſte, he hath ſlayne my ſonne Lohier. But by my crowne yf he haue ſo doone, or any thynge that turneth to dyſpleaſure or dommage to my ſayd ſonne: I ſhal go vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him wyth a hundred thouſand men and ſhall make hym to be hanged at a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gybet. Syr ſayd the good Duke Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Dordonne, I ſhall come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ryght ſore, yf he hath offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded againſt you that ye make punyſſyon therof and wreke on hym greate venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce. He is your liege man, and ought to ſerue, prayſe and honoure you. Alwayes yf he hath treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed agaynſt you in any manere I am ryght ſorye for it, and yf ye haue a cauſe to be wrothe wyth hym, I haue heare my foure ſonnes, That
<pb facs="tcp:7017:11"/> is to wyt Reynawde Alarde Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde and Rycharde, that ben ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght valyaunt as ye ſyr well knowe which ſhalbe truſty and true to you. Aymon ſayd the kyng Charlemayn I conne you great thanke of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre that nowe ye haue doone to me.</p>
            <p>And it is my wyll that ye make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come hether preſently to the ende that I make them knightes, and I ſhall gyue to them Caſtelles, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and Townes, and Cities ynou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gh. Than ſent the duke Aymes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent for hys children, and made them to come afore kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne. And whan the king Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſaw them: they pleaſed him moche, and Reynawde was the firſt that ſpake and ſayd. Syr yf it pleaſe yon for to make vs knyghtes, we ſhalbe euer redy for to ſerue you and your noble Lordſhyp. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king Charlemayne called hys ſtewarde and ſayd to hym. Bringe to me the armes that were the kynge Cedres whyche I haue wyth my handes ſlayne in batayle before Pampelune and ſhall gyue theym to the gentyll Reynawde as to hym that is as I wene the moſte valyaunt of all, and of other good armes I ſhall gyue to the other three bretherne. So brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght there the ſtewarde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armes that were full fayre and riche, and than were armed the foure gentyl brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> children to the good Aimes of dordo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and Ogyer of Denmarke that was of theyr kynne dyd on theyr ſpurres to the new knight Reynaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, &amp; the kynge Charlemayne gyrde hym his ſwearde, and than doubed him to a Knighte ſayinge God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace in thee goodnes, honour, and worthines. And than mounted Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde on horſbacke vpon Bayard that was ſuche a horſe, that neuer was his like in all the world nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall be except Buſifal the horſe of the great Kinge Alexander. For as for to haue ronne .xxx. myle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wolde neuer haue ſweted.</p>
            <p>The ſayd Bayard thys horſe was growen in the Iſle of Boruſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Mawgys the ſonne of the duke Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aygremount had gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his coſin Reynawde, that after made the Kynge Charlemayne full wrothe and ſory, as ye ſhal now heare here after.</p>
            <p>REynawde was a horſe backe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Sheelde paynted hangyng at his necke, and thwerled his ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de by great fyerſneſſe. And wyt wel that he was a fayre knight woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful great and well founded, and of hym was a fayre ſyght, for well he ſemed one of the moſte valyaunt Knightes that men coulde fynde in all the worlde. And the Barons that were there ſayde. Ha god what a fayre Knight is he? Neuer was nor ſhall be ſene ſo fayre a man of ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes as Reynawde, god encreaſe to hym honour and worthyneſſe, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and pryſe. And after were moche honourably and worthily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed and armed the other three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne of Reynawde, and ſith lyght all on horſebacke vnder Saint Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor nyghe Parys. Than made the kinge Charlemayne to ſet vp in the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:7017:11"/> grounde a poſte agaynſt whyche he made the new knightes for to aſſaye them ſelfe. They Iuſted moche wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely, but Reynawde Iuſted beſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his horſe bayarde, &amp; ryght well lyked and were a greable vnto char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne the faytes of the valyaunt knyght Reynawde, vnto whome the king ſayd, Reynawde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hens forth ye ſhal come with vs in batayle and Reynawde anſwered him in thys maner. Syr god yelde it you an hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred thouſand tymes, and I promit you in good fayth to obey and ſerue you truly. Nor neuer ye ſhall fynde my ſelfe in no forfayte, but yf it com of you.</p>
            <p>THe Emperour Charlemaine after the Iuſtynge was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one: he retourned to his Palays in Parys. Than he reſoned wyth hys prynces and Baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and there were the duke Naymes of bauyres Oger the dane and the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ieth ſo longe in hys meſſage I haue great feare that ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent be happed vnto hym. I dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this night in my ſlepe that the thonder bolte fell vpon my Sonne Lohier, and then came the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aygremount vpon hym and ſmote his head of, but by my bearde yf he haue doone ſo: whyles he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he ſhall neuer accorde with me. Nor I ſhall neuer haue Ioye at my herte. For it is he that I loue beſt in this worlde. Syr ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes I beleue not ſuch thinges, nor vnto ſuche dremes ye ſhall not gyue no credence, alwayes ſayde the king yf he haue doone ſo: I ſhall neuer le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him the value of a peny, for I ſhall ſende for the Normans, the Bernyge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as they ſpake thus: there came rydi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger vpon a horſe fauell ſore ſicke and werye, and alſo ſore wounded vnto the death. He came vnto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys afore the Palays where Kyng Charlemayne was at the wyndow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And whan he ſawe come the Meſſanger: he came downe lightlye from the Palays halle vnto the gate and with him Naymes of Bauyer and Ogyer the Dane. And whan the Meſſanger ſaw the kinge: he ſalued him fall ſoft as he that was ryght ſorye and ſore wounded, and that wyth payne myght ſpeake, and ſaid in this maner wyſe. Great folye ye dyd, whan ye dyd ſende my Lorde your ſonne for to aſke trybute and obeyſſaunce of the Duke Benes of Aygremounte, the whiche trybute your ſonne aſked him ſha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fully, but the duke whiche is ſore fel and cruel whan he heard ſpeak my ſayd lorde your ſonne: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to a mayny of knightes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould betake &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould neuer retourne agayn to you for to recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his meſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge nor what anſwere he had founde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which taki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medle was great
<pb facs="tcp:7017:12"/> and cruell, ſo that your dere ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hier was dead there. And the Duke Benes of Aygremount kylled hym and all your folke except me and .ix other that conduyte and bryng your ſonne in a byere. And I my ſelfe am ſore hurt as ye may ſe. And than the meſſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger could ſpeake no more. But fell downe in a ſwoune of the greate greefe and ſore that he felte bycauſe of hys woundes. And whan the ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g had heard theſe wordes: he fel down vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for the great ſorow that he tooke therof and wrange his handes, and pulled his beard. And tare all hys heres ſayinge. Ha good lorde that made heauen and erth, ye haue brought me in great ſorowe &amp; tourment Irrecouerable that neuer ſhall ceaſe with me. So requyre I vnto you the death humbly. For ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer more deſyre I not to lyue. The good duke of Bauyre began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort him, ſayinge. For goddes loue ſyr tourment not your ſelf, but haue good hert and hope in god and recomfort your folke. And thys wolde ſay the duke Naymes for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he ſaw weepe there for theyr ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men and freendes that were dead w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lohier.

And than ye ſhall goe vpon the Duke Benes of Aygremount wyth all your noble power, and great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſſaunce, and ſhall deſtroy hym and all hys landes at your pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Than the kinge Charlemayne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted him ſelfe, and well he knew that Naymes cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelled hym truly and lawfully. Than ſayd the kyng, Barons make redy, and wee ſhall go agaynſt my dere ſonne Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier. And incontinent all the pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Barons made them ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye for to doo the commaundement of the kinge. And whan they were gone two myle out of Parys: they met with the corps. And were there with the Kinge Naymes Ogyer. Sampſon of bourgoyne, and many other great Lordes. Than ſayd the kinge Charlemayne whan he ſawe the body of his deere ſonne Lohier: Alas how ſhamefully am I created? he deſcended from his horſe a foote, &amp; tooke vp the cloth that was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the biere &amp; behelde his ſonne Lohier. Than ſaw he the head y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſmyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of from the body and the face that was all to Hewen. Ha good Lorde ſayd he, how well maye I be made now al quicke, well I ought for to hate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Benes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te that thus hath murdered my ſonne, he than kiſſed his childe al bloudiful often and ſaid vnto him in this wiſe. Ha faire ſonne ye were a talle man and a gentil knight. Now praye I the puyſſant God of glorye that he take your ſoule this yf it be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into hys Realme of Paradyſe. Great ſorow made the kyng Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne for the death of his ſonne Lohier. But alwayes recomforted him the good Duke Naymes And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ogyer the Dane and Sampſon of Bourgoyne tooke him vnder the armes of him and ledde him vnto ſaynt Germayne of the medowes. And there the bodye of Lohier was buried and enoynted with balme as it apperteyneth vnto all the ſonnes
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:7017:12"/> of kinges. Thus was he put into hys graue God haue of hys Soule mercy.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall bene heere to ſpeake of the good king Charlemayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was moch ſori of his ſonne Lohier as ye haue heard, and ſhall tell you of the good Duke Aymon of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, his ſonne, and of his three bretherne that were at Parys. My children ſayd Aymon, ye know how the Kynge Charlemayne is moche wrothe and not without a cauſe, by cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my brother your vnkle hath ſlaine Lohier his ſonne. And I wote well that he ſhall go vpon him with all his puyſſaunce, but verelye we ſhall not go wyth him. But rather ſhall we goe to Dordon, and yf the Kyng make warre agaynſt hym we ſhall helpe him with all our power. So lyghted anon on horſebacke the good duke Aymon &amp; the foure knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes his children, and bayted no wher tyll they came to Laon &amp; from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they rode ſo longe tyll they came to Dordon.

Than the good duke anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red yea, and after ſhe aſked why they were departed fro the kinges court? And than he reherſed vnto her word by word, how hys brother the duke Benes had ſlayne Lohier the ſonne of the Kinge Charlemayne.

For well ſhe knew that this death of Lohier was the totalle dyſtruccion of the Duke Aymon her houſbande of her ſelf and of her childerne and of their lande. She heard Renawde her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Sonne that thretened Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne the great Kynge, then ſayd to hym the Ladye hys Mother. My Sonne Reynawde I pray thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande me alytle. Loue thy ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne and thy naturall Lorde, and dread him aboue all thinge, and bere him honour and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And God ſhall rewarde thee for it, and ye my Lorde Aymon I am moche maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of you that are departed from Charlemayne without leaue of him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hath doone to you ſo moche good and ſo great worſhip, and hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to your ſonnes ſo noble and ſo riche armes and hath made them knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with his owne handes, more great honour he might not doo to you nor to your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Lady ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke we be thus departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> King Charlemayne becauſe that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſlayne his ſonne as I haue tolde you afore. A God ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady that of the virgin was borne in beth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lehem, howe hath that euyll thys day ſurmounted the good? For god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des loue my Lorde ſayde the Ladye medle not withall. For ye ſhall ſee this next ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer that the kinge ſhall go vpon your brother, &amp; by my coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell ſerue the kynge your rightwyſe Lorde, nor fayle him for nothynge. For and ye doo otherwyſe: ye ſhall be vntrew and falſe towarde your Souerayne and naturall Lorde.</p>
            <p>Lady ſayd the duke by god omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente I wold leuer haue loſt my caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
<pb facs="tcp:7017:13"/> and the halfe of my lande, than that my brother ſhould haue ſlayne Lohier. Now the wyl of god be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne therin, and none other wyſe.</p>
            <p>TO ſpeake of the good Duke Aymon of Dordo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of his wife the ducheſſe and of theyr ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes: we ſhal heere leue, &amp; ſhall returne to ſpeake of kynge Charlemayne that was come agayne to parys, maki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g great ſorowe for his ſonne Lohier. There had you ſeene many a gowne torne &amp; broken, many a hande wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, and manye heares of the head pulled ſo that it was piti and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for to ſe. Alas mi dere ſonne ſaid kyng Charlemayne, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath ſlayne thee ſo cruelly loued me but lytle. I ſhall neuer be in quiete nor in reſte till that I haue take vengeaunce of thy death. Syr ſayd the duke Bauy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ere haue mercy of your ſelfe. For it behoueth not ſo great a prince as ye be for to make ſo great ſorow as ye doo. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane whyle came a meſſenger afore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge, which ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to him howe Aymon Duke of Dordon &amp; his foure ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes were gon into their countrie, wherof the kyng was ſore an angred and wrothe.</p>
            <p>And ſware god and ſaynt Denis y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afore he ſholde dye: that Aymon and his chylderen ſholde abye full ſore for it &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Benes of Aygre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te ſholde not kepe them therfro The dyner was redy &amp; they waſſhed their handes and were ſet at dinner but wyt it that the kynge dyd eate but lytle, as he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was in greate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancolye, &amp; the fayre Salamon ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that day afore hym the cuppe, &amp; great people was there. After diner the Emperour Charlemayne did rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon with his barons and ſayd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (lorde ſayd he) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Benes of Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremount hath doone to me greate outrage y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo ſhamefully hath ſlayne my ſonne Lohier. But and it pleaſe God I ſhall go wreke it vpon hym this next ſomer and I ſhall deſtroye all his land, and yf I may take him I ſhall not leaue hym for the duke Aymon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhamefullye is gone from mee, nor for his foure ſonnes that I haue made knightes wherof I me repente ſore, but that I ſhall make them to be hanged. Syr ſayd than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naymes nowe heare what I ſhal ſay to you, your ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne is dead by great vnhap &amp; well in an euill hour was he put to death, for neuer death was ſo ſore ſolde ne ſo dere bought as this ſhalbe. So ſende nowe for your folke through all your londes, and than from hens toward Aygre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte take your waye. And yf ye may take the Duke Benes, let the death of your ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Lohier be to him ful dere ſoulde.</p>
            <p>NAymes ſayd the kynge ye be a good man, ſage curtoyſe &amp; valyaunt, euen thus ſhall I doo, for well wyſely ye haue counſelled me. Than gaue he leaue to many of hys barons and gentil men that were in his courte at that time &amp; tolde them that eche of them ſhould go into his countrie for to make them ſelf redy, and that they ſhould come agayne to him the next ſommer. So was it doone as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge had commaunded And thus wente the barons and the gentil men from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courte into theyr
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:7017:13"/> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, and by them were tydinges brought through all the landes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rome, that kynge Charlemayne made a great aſſemble of men of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, ſo that the renome therof flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe vnto the duke Benes of Aygre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountes court, which of that other parte dyd ſende for his kynſmen and freendes, and in eſpeciall for his bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thern Gerarde of Rouſſylon, and Dron of Nantuel, ſo that they were wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came together well foure ſcore thouſand fyghtynge men and mo, and as fayre folke as euer were ſene, whiche than ſayde I beleue yf the kynge beſyege the Caſtell: that the worſe ſhall returne vnto hym. Than ſayd the Duke Benes of Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremount to Gerarde of Rouſſilon. Brother ſayd he be not dyſmayed, for I hope to hurte the kyng ſo ſore yf he come vpon vs: that he ſhal be wery of his bargayn, but let vs goe forth towarde Troy in cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paygne and there wee ſhall fyght wyth the kynge vygorouſly. For well I wote that God ſhall helpe vs agaynſt hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This was at the begynnyng of the moneth of Maye, and Charlemayn was at Paris, that abode after hys men that ſhould come, for to go with a great puyſſaunce vpon the Duke Benes of Aygremount. And bode not longe that Rychard of Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy came to the kynge wyth .xxx. thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſande fyghtyng men. And of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſyde came to hym the Erle Guy that had wyth hym a ryght noble &amp; a great company of good men, and after hym came Salamon of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and the Erle Huon. And of al ſydes ye ſhould haue ſene come to the Kynge Charlemayne Poeteui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Gaſcoyns, Normans, Flemynges, Bernyers, and Bourgoynes, and ſo many other great Lordes that it was great wonder for to ſee, which came all and Lodged themſelfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medowes of ſaynt Germayne.</p>
            <p>THan whan the kyng Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne knew that this folke was all arryued: he had of it greate Ioye, and incontynent made hys ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayles to departe, for to goe to hys enterpryſe, and made of Rychard of Normandy, of Valleran of Buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, of Guydellon of bauyere, of yza<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>car of Nemours, of Oger the bane. and of Eſcouf the ſonne of Oedon wyth them .xl. thouſande men hys forewarde. There ſhould ye haue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ryght noble companye, and manye hardi men, they departed from nigh Parys. And put them ſelf to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way ſtrayght to Aygremounte, and they (thꝰ rydyng after many dayes Iur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney whiche I can not tel) came there ſtreyght to Ogyer the Dane that was in the forewarde a meſſanger ſore haſtyly rydynge. That aſked to whome was thys noble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, and he anſwered to hym that they were kynge Charlemaynes folke. Than ſayd ſyr the meſſanger that he wolde well ſpeake wyth hym, than went Oger the Dane and ſhewed hym the kyng. And aſſone as the meſſanger ſaw hym: he made hym due reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and the kyng gaue hym agayne hys ſalute, and him demaunded what he was and fro whens he came? and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meſſanger tolde hym that he was of Troye and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnto him he was ſent
<pb facs="tcp:7017:14"/> fro Aubery the lorde of Troye that was his liege man, whiche beſought hym humbly for ſocoures. For the Duke Benes of Aygremount, &amp; his two bretherne Gerarde of Rouſſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and Dron of Nantuel and with theim an hundred thouſande figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men had beſyeged him within Troye. And that yf ye came not to helpe hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he muſt yelde vp the towne, alſo the fayre towre that Iulius Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar dyd buylde there.</p>
            <p>WHan Charlemayne the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour vnderſtode that Troi was beſyeged by the duke Benes &amp; his bretherne, he was full ſory of it and he ſwore by Saynte Denys of Fraunce, that he ſhould go there w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys army, and that yf he might hold the duke of Aygremounte he ſhould make hym dye a ſhamefull death, ſo called he the Duke Naymes of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyere, Goodebew of fryſe, and the Duke Walleran and ſayd to theym. Barons ye vnderſtande what thys meſſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger ſayth, let vs ryde haſtelye towarde Troy or it be take, and they anſwered to hym ryght gladly that they wolde doo it ſo. So dyd they ryde a good pace tyll that they came nyghe Troye. And firſte of all came the forewarde with the Oryflame. Of the whyche were gouernours Ogyer the Dane, Rycharde of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, &amp; the duke Walleran, and w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> them fourty thouſand men. And the Meſſanger of Troy that conduyted them. And whan they were come ſo nyghe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſawe Troye afore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: a meſſanger came to Gerard of rouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyllon that was afore Troy, ſaying to hym that the kinge Charlemayne came vpon them for to ſocoure Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery with a ryght great &amp; puiſſaunt companye. Than layde Gerarde to hys bretherne, that is to wyte Duke Benes of Aygremount, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Erle Dron of Nantuell that it were good that they ſhould go agaynſte kynge Charlemayne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all theyr puiſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and that eche of them ſhould proue himſelf a good man. They did ſo as they had deuyſed, and Gerarde of Rouſſillon was the firſt in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and they rode ſo longe till y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one partye ſaw the other. Than ſayd Ogier the Dane to Richard of Normandy whan he ſawe come Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarde of Rouſſillon ſe: ſayd he howe Gerard of Rouſſyllon weneth for to fare foule with vs. But now let vs thynke for to defende vs wel, ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che that the worſhyp abyde to the Kyng Charlemayne and to vs. And than they let renne theyr horſes fro one parte and fro the other, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarde of Rouſſyllon wente &amp; ſmote an Almayne wyth his ſpeare ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che, that he made it to entre through the body of hym. Whiche fell anon dead to the ground, and Gerard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke his baner &amp; cryed with an high voyce Rouſſyllon Rouſſyllon.</p>
            <p>THan began the batayle ſore ſtronge fell and cruell. And whan Ogyer the dane ſaw thus his folke dye; he was wood and mad with it. So went he and ſmote a kni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ght named Pouſon by ſuche a wyſe that he put his ſpere thorough the body of hym whiche fel downe dead afore him. And whan Gerarde had ſeen the ſame: he went and ſmote one of Ogyers men, ſo that all dead he
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:7017:14"/> caſt him afore hym. And then he ſaid ye haue this for your mayſters ſake Ogyer. Muche great and meruayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous was the ſtoure and the batayle ſo fiers. For there ſhould ye haue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſo many of ſheeldes perced and clouen, and ſo mani a habergeon bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken, and ſalettes and helmes vnbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled and ſore beten, and ſo many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lying vpon the other dead, that all the earth was couered with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of the dead men (and of theym that were hurt there) ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it was a great pitie to for to ſee. And than came the duke Benes of Aygremounte that ſpurred hys horſe terrtblie, and we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſmote Enguerran lorde of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roune &amp; of ſaint Quintine ſo harde that he ouerthrew him dead afore hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and than ſayd. Now go goddes cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe haue thou, and cryed with an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe voyce Aygremounte, and than came to him his brother the Duke of Nantuell with all his folke, and they went al together vpon Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes folke, and of the other part came with great puiſſaunce. Almay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes poeteuins and Lumbardes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were of the parte of kinge Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne. So medled theym ſelfe the one party amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the other. And ther was moche harde and horryble aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For there were ſlayne many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghty and worthy knightes of bothe ſides, and Richarde of Normandye ſhewed wel there his great proweſſe and worthines. For he wente and ſmote a knight y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gerarde of Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon loued moche by ſuche a ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth that he ouerthrewe hym dead from his horſe to the erth afore the ſayd Gerarde. Whiche than ſayd.</p>
            <p>Now am I wel ſory and wrothe for hym that now is dead that I loued ſo ſore, certes I ſhal neuer haue Ioy at my hert but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I be auenged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhortlye. Than tooke Gerarde of Rouſſillon his baner in his fiſt. But hys brother Nantuell came anon to hym and ſayd, brother I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell you that ye tourne agayne. For here co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Charlemayne wyth hys folk, and well I tell you that yf wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde hym: the loſſe ſhall tourne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs. And whyle they were ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge thus: Walleran of Bollon ſmote y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neuew of Gerarde of Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon ſo that he foyned at hym, with his ſwerde through the body of hym &amp; fell downe dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth. Than trowed Gerarde to haue gone out of his wytte, and ſente anon for the duke Benes his brother y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould come ſoone to ſuccoure him, and he dyd ſo as pren and valyaunt that he was. And of the other ſyde aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled there the kynge and hys folke.</p>
            <p>¶ So ſhal you now hear of a thing meruaylous of ſo greate a nobles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> at the ſame feeld were cruelly ſlayn. This was in the moneth of Maye vpon a mornynge that kyng Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne did aſſemble his folke with the folke of the duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te and of his bretherne. To the whych aſſemble ye ſhould haue ſene manye fayre harnayſes ſhynynge for the Sunne that fayre and cleare was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day, the whyche aſſemble was wun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfull ſtronge. For there were ſo many feete and heades ſmytten of &amp; ſo many good horſes ſlayne, and the other ranne thorough the medowes wherof the mayſters lay dead vpon
<pb facs="tcp:7017:15"/> the graſſe. And wyt it for trouthe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were dead that ſame day of the one ſyde and of the other: more than xl. thouſand men. A God what ſlau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter, there was muche great nobles dead. The duke Benes ſore angred went and ſmote ſyr Walter Lorde of Pierrele in his ſhielde ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys ſpere went through the body of hym and fell downe dead afore hym. Than cryed he with an hye voyce his baner Aygremounte.</p>
            <p>GReat was the preas, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle fyers and meruaylous. And there ſhewed Rychard of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy much worthili his great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes. For he Iuſted agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo that he perced hys ſheelde and dyd hurt hym right ſore and ſayd to him by God ye ſhall not thys daye eſcape death. It was an euyll daye for you whan ye dyd ſlea my Lorde Lohier, &amp; with that he did draw out his ſwerde, and ſmote the duke agayne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his helme in ſuch a wiſe that if it had not ben a coyfe of ſteele that made his ſtroke to ſlide the ſaid Benes had be dead y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre And the ſtroke fell downe vpon the horſe, &amp; cut y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſe in two as though it had be nothing. And thus fell the horſe dead vnder hys mayſter. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke Benes ſore abaſſhed whan he thus fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him ſelf a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d But he ſtoode vpon his feete redely as he that was preu and valyaunte holdyng his ſwerde in his hande, &amp; went and ſmote a knight named ſir Symon ſo that he kylled hym ſterke dead in the place. And than he called wyth an highe voyce. Aygremount his baner. Than came to hym hys two bretherne, the Duke of Rouſſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and of Nantuell, and of the ſide of kinge Charlemayne came Ogyer Naymes, Wallera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Bollon, Huo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lorde of Mauns the Erle Salamon Leon of Friſe the archebiſſhop Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyn and Eſcoufe the ſonne of Oedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And than ſhould ye haue ſene there at that aſſemble muche great &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayllous nobleſſe of knyghtes that lay dead vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erth, the one vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other that it was a pyteous ſyght for to beholde.</p>
            <p>TO this inhumayne occyſion was come the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne cryinge barons if they eſca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe vs we ſhall neuer haue honoure, and than he bare vp his ſpere to the reſt and went and ſmote into the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elde of Gerarde of Rouſſyllon ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ouerthrew both horſe and man to the ground, and there had be his laſt daye yf it had not ben the Duke Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Dron his brethern, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> muche worthely and wyth great dylyge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſuccoured hym. Of that other party came Ogyer the Dane vpon hys good horſe Broyforte that ſmote a knyght of the folke of Gerard duke of Rouſſyllon called Syr Foulquer ſo that he cloue him to the teeth and fell downe dead vnto the erth. And whan Gerarde of Rouſſyllon ſawe thus hys knyght ſlayne he called to god &amp; to our lady ſaying. Well haue I thys daye loſt my fayre and good knight. And the duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was ſore abaſſhed and prayed God alſo full pyteouſly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it wolde pleaſe hym to kepe hym from death, and
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:7017:15"/> from fallynge in to the handes of Charlemayne. Nyghe was the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vnder and it was well aboute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plyn tyme &amp; the fyghters of the one parte &amp; of the other were voery &amp; ſore chauffed, And ſo wythdrewe the thre bretherne abacke vnto theyr Tentes with moche wrathe, and in eſpecyal Gerarde of Rouſſyllon that had loſt that day Aymanoy his coſyn and a hundred other of the beſt Knyghtes of his company. And he ſayd in this wyſe. An euyll houre it was whan the ſonne of Charlemain was ſlain. Than came to hym the duke Benes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bledyng as he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was horriblie wounded. And whan Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarde ſaw hym: he began to ſygh te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſayinge. Fayre brother are ye wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to death? Nay ſayd he I ſhal ſoone be whole. Than ſwore Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarde the duke of Rouſſyllon that to morow at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne riſing: He ſhould begyn agayn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> batayle againſt king Charlemayne and hys folke wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thyrty thouſande ſhal loſe their lyues. Alas for god nay ſayd his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther the Duke Nantuell. But yf ye wyll doo my counſell we ſhall ſende xxx. of the wyſeſt knightes that wee haue vnto kynge Charlemayne, and by our ſayd knyghtes we ſhall doo hym to wyt and ſhew hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bli y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he haue pitie and mercy of vs, and that the Duke Benes our brother ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende hym the death of hys ſonne Lohier euen ſo as it ſhalbe aduyſed by the prynces &amp; barons of hys fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawſhyp and of ours, &amp; ye know wel all redy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ben hys lyege men, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for to warre agaynſt hym we doo cruel falſhed, &amp; yet more it is, that yf he had loſte all his folke that he hath here with him, or euer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were a mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth paſſed he ſhould haue recouered twyſe as many, ſo may we nothing doo agaynſt hym. And therfore may we nothyng doo againſt him, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you my brethern, that ye wyll doo thus, &amp; to hym anſwered his two bretherne that they wolde doo it, ſyn that he counſelled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded together y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould ſende thyther as ſoone as it were day. They made that nyght good watche vnto the morning, and than they made redi their meſſangers for to ſende to the kyng Charlemayne, And whan they were redy: Gerarde of Rouſſyllon ſayd to them. Lordes ſay wel to kynge Charlemayne that we be ſore dyſpleaſed of the death of hys ſonne Lohier. and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our brother the duke Benes repenteth him ſelfe of it full ſore, &amp; that yf it pleaſe hym to haue mercy of vs that we ſhal go &amp; ſerue hym where it ſhal pleaſe him to ſende vs wyth .x. thouſand fygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge men. And alſo ye ſhall ſaye to Naymes of Bauyere that we pray hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wyll enploy hymſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the kyng Charlemayne that this accorde may be had.</p>
            <p>AFter that the meſſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers had well all alonge vnderſtand what they ſhould ſaye to the Kynge Charlemaine from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three brethern dukes: They lyghted on horſbacke eche of them, berynge braunches of Olyue tree in their handes, in token of peace. And ceaſed not to ryde tyll that they were come afore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tente of the kinge charlemayne. Than ſpake
<pb facs="tcp:7017:16"/> one of them whiche was named ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that ſalued the king in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Syr I praye our lorde that of his grace giue you good lyfe &amp; long. And wyt ſyr that the duke Gerarde of Rouſſyllon and the Duke Benes of Aygremount and Dron of Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuell ben come hither the whiche cry you mercye, and beſeche you ryght humbly that it pleaſe you to pardon them the death of your ſonne Lohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Of the whiche they are wrothe &amp; ſory. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Aygremount let you wyte by vs, that yf it be your pleaſure to doo ſo: that he and hys bretherne ſhalbe your lyege men, &amp; ſhall come to ſerue you with .x. thou ſand fyghting men in all that ſhalbe your pleaſur to enploy them, ſyr for goddes ſake haue remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that god forgaue his death to Longes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruelly ſticked him to the hart. wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſyr pleaſe it you to pardon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; take them to your good grace. And of this right hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly they beſeche you.</p>
            <p>WHan the kynge Charlemayne had thus heard ſpeake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſangers of the three brethern: He fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peled his forehead, &amp; knitted his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wes, and looked full angrely, and at that houre he anſwered to them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, and than ſoone after he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake in this maner. Bi my fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th ſyr Steuen ſayde he well had the duke Benes loſt his wittes whan he ſo ſhamfully ſlew my deere ſonne Lohier, whiche I loued ſo tenderly. Now is he my man wyll he or not. Syr ſayd Steue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am certayne that he ſhall doo to you all reaſon to the direction of your good counſell.</p>
            <p>Than ſayd the kinge of this we ſhal counſeyll vs, and withdrewe hym a lytle a ſide, and called to him duke Naymes. Ogyer the Dane, ſyr Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon. Huon of Mauns. Walleran of Bollon. Odet of Langres, and Leon of Fryſe, &amp; ſayd to them. Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des heere ben the meſſangers of the duke Benes and of his bretherne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſende me worde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wyll come for to ſerue me where my wyl ſhalbe wyth .x. thouſand good fyghting me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yf we wyll pardon theym the death of my ſonne Lohyer. And they ſhall be our vaſſayle and true liege men, &amp; of vs they ſhall holde theyr landes and theyr lordeſhips. Syr anſwered the duke Naimes in this is nothing but well. So counſell I you that ye pardon them. For they be muche valyaunte, and of great renome.</p>
            <p>Wherfore pardon them yf it pleaſe you.</p>
            <p>THan by the Counſell of the Duke Naymys of Bauyere the kynge dyd pardon the three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne &amp; called to him the .iii. knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and ſaid to them, how he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the three dukes the death of his ſonne Lohier, by ſuche a condicion that the duke Benes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould come for to ſerue hym at the feaſt of Saynt Iohn next comynge wyth .x. thouſand fyghtyng men wel arayed, and ye ſhall tel to them that they ſurely come nowe to me for to take of theym theyr othe and fayth that they ſhall fro hens forthe, obey and ſerue truly. And that of me they ſhall holde all theyr landes. Then departed the knyghtes from afore
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:7017:16"/> the kyng Charlemayne and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne vnto the Dukes and ſhewed vnto them how they had ſped of their meſſage with the king Charlemayn wherof the three brethern thanked much humbly our lorde God. Then ſayd the duke Rycharde of Rouſſyllo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is reaſon that we take of our good gownes and go to the kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne naked and crye hym mercy of this that we haue thus offended agaynſt his hygh puyſſaunce &amp; lorde ſhyp, and the other two brethern an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwered that well they ought to doo ſo. So tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble knyghtes their clothes of, and al naked bare foote and in poore eſtate departed from theyr lodges, and well foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande knightes wyth them all bare fote and in their ſhertes, and in ſuch eſtate as were theyr mayſters. In thys wyſe they came tofore the king Charlemayne. And wyt wel that in right great humilitie were ſet the three bretherne for to haue peace and accorde wyth the kyng Charlemain that was wroth to them ſpecyally to the Duke of Aygremount as more playnlye ye ſhall heare here after.</p>
            <p>WHan the kynge Charlemayn ſawe thus come y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne wyth theyr barons &amp; knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: he called to hym the duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes &amp; many other barons, and ſayd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can ye not tell me what folke ye ſee yonder comyng? Syr ſayd the dukes Naymes it is the Duke Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aygremount with his folke, that come for to requyre you of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. (This hanging) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke Benes of Aygremount came afore the king and caſt hymſelfe vpon hys knee, &amp; ſayd vnto hym in this wiſe.

            <p>Than whan the kynge ſawe theym thus come humblie towarde hys preſence in theyr ſhertes &amp; barefoote and had hearde this that the Duke of Aygremount had ſayd to hym: he had of them ryght great pitie, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them the death of his Sonne Lohier and all his euyll wyll. Than ſhould ye haue ſene from one part &amp; from the other kyſſe and colle eche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their kynneſmen, and ſom wept for Ioye and the other for pitie.</p>
            <p>WHan were peaſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the king Charlemayne by the counſel of the good duke Raymos: than ſware &amp; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the three brethern good fydelitie to the kynge Charlemayne, and that they ſhould ſerue him at all tymes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould cal for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So tooke they a glad leue from the kynge, but the kynge charged the Duke of Aygre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount that ſhe ſhould come to ſerue hym at the feaſt of ſaynt Iohn next comynge.

For in good ſoth we ſhould ſlea hym. Guenꝭ ſaid the king it were treaſon, for we haue gyuen to hym trewes, alwayes doo with it your wyll, ſo that the ſynne tourne not vpon me, &amp; kepe you. for in certayne the duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ryght mighty &amp; of great kynred, &amp; well ye myght happe to haue a doo yf ye fulfil in this your owne ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

            <p>WHan the mornynge came: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted well erly fro Parys the ſayd Guenelon and his felawes and wyth them well foure thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fyghtynge men, and neuer they tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tyll that they came in the valey of Soyſſons, and there thei recountred the Duke Benes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys puyſſaunce and whan the Duke Benes ſawe them come: he ſayd to his folke. lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des I trow that yonder be ſome fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of the kynges that retourne again from the courte. It is no force ſayd one of his knightes. I wote not what it may be ſaid the duke. For the king Charlemayne is ſore vengeable for to auenge hym ſelf, and alſo he hath with hym a lynage of folke the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be fell and cruell. It is Guenes Foulquet of Moryllon and certayne other of his courte, and in trouth to night in my ſleape I dreamed that a Gryffon came out of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens that perced my ſheelde and all myne armes, ſo that hys nayles ſtacke into my Lyuer and my myl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and all my men were therof in great tourme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; they all were eaten
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:7017:17"/> wyth bores and of Lions, and none of them ſcaped, but one alone. And alſo me ſemed that out of my mouth yſſued a whyte Doue. Than ſayde one of hys knightes that it was all but well, &amp; that for cauſe of thys dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he ought not to diſmay hymſelf. I wote not ſayde the duke what god ſhall ſende me, but of thys my herte dredeth. So co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the duke Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes that euery man ſhould arme hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfe, &amp; hys knyghtes anſwered that ryght gladly they wolde ſo doo. So began eueryche of them to ſeeke his armes and habylyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>res. Here ſhal you heare of the harde hewynge and of a thynge heuy to be recounted of the great ſlaughter that made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tray tour Guenellon of the good Duke Benes of Aygremount.</p>
            <p>THe Erle Guenes rode wyth great force that was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtronge and fyers &amp; well accompanyed. Than went and met with the Duke Benes fyrſte Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of Moryllon the whiche ſayde to him that he had doone il for to ſlea Lohyer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eldeſt ſonne of king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne, but or euer the euyn cam: he ſhould haue a ſory rewarde for it. Whan the duke vnderſtode hym: he meruayled hym ſelfe muche and ſaid Ha god howe myght one kepe hym from traytours. Alas I helde the king Charlemayne for a true prince &amp; I ſe now the contrary but a fore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I dye I ſhall ſell my death ful dere. Than went they &amp; fought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty agaynſt the other muche angry in ſo muche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Guenes ſmote by force the duke his coſyn Reyner ſo that he ouerthrew hym downe dead to the erthe afore his fete and after he cried with an hye voyce, ſmite on knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for he ſlew my good coſin Lohier the duke Benes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not accorde with me, but nowe I ſhall ſell it him ful deare. So ran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guenes &amp; his folke vpon the duke of Aygremount, and the Duke ryght worthyly defended himſelf &amp; ſmote a knyght named ſyr Fawcon ſo that he ſhoued his ſwerde into the bodye of hym, and he fell dead afore hym. And after thys the Duke Benes of Aygremount tooke himſelfe for to weepe ſtrongly, &amp; wiſſhed much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his two brethern &amp; alſo after his neuewes. Alas ſayd he deere Sonne Mawgys where be you now that ye be not here for well I wote yf ye wyſte this enterpryſe ye ſhould well ſuccour me.

            <p>HYers was the bataile &amp; right harde to endure, but well ye may wyt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t myght not reſyſte agaynſt ſo manye folke. For he had not with him but two hundred knyghtes, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were more than foure thouſand thus were they euyll matched. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ye haue ſene that dai ſo moch braynes in the feelde, ſo manye feete and heades ſmyten of, that it was a pytious thyng to behold. After cam yet agayne Guenes that ſmote Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſſelyne of Bloy ſo that he caſted hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dead to the erth, and he made ſoone to goe backe the Duke Benes folke of Aygremounte. Than was ſore a baſſhed the duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the whyche knewe well that wythoute death he myght not eſcape. So went he and ſmote one of Guenes folke ſo great a ſtroke that he ouerthrew him dead. For none other wyſe he coulde doo, but defende hym ſelfe as well as he could for to length his lyfe wythall. Ha god what a greate dommage it was to haue thus ſham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully betrayed hym. For after many chyrches many townes and Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were therfore ſet in a fyre, and ſo many great nobles full pyteouſlye brought to death. So much ſped the traytour Guenes agaynſt the good duke of Aygremount that the folke of the duke were weke &amp; almoſt go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For of two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had brought he had no moe with hym, but fourty Barons: ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Benes of ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremount ye ſe that we ben almoſte all dead yf we defende vs not wyth great herte and worthynes.

For ye ſe that here pyteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly we muſt departe &amp; breake felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp. Than wente the duke agayne &amp; ſmote a knight named ſyr Helye, ſo that he made hym to fall dead to the erth. And than cryed with an hyghe voyce Smyte well barons. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was fayre and ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noyſe that was made there, &amp; at that hour one named Gryffon of Hautefell, wente &amp; ſmote the dukes horſe into the breſte wyth hys ſpere ſo that he ouerthrew him vnder the horſe, and the duke anon aroſe vpon his feete, &amp; tooke his ſwerde wenyng to ſmite the ſayd Gryffon, but the ſtroke fell vpon the horſe ſo that he cutte him a ſonder as it had ben nothynge.</p>
            <p>WHan the duke of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaw himſelfe thus on foote he knew wel that it was doone of him but well he ſware that hys death he ſhould ſell ryght dere, but ſodaynly came there vpon him the erle Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that ſat vpon a good courſer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which ſmote the duke Benes of Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremounte with his ſpeare ſuche a ſtroke, that he ſhoued hym through &amp; through his body, &amp; thus fell downe dead the duke Benes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Griffon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of the ſayd Guenes came to the Duke Benes of Aygremou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that lay dead vpon the ſande &amp; ſhoued his ſwerde

No more we ſhal ſaide duke Aimon, but wel I pray god to haue mercye of his ſoule, for he was a right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knight.

<pb facs="tcp:7017:20"/> grymly and fyerſſly in his viſage for greate wrath and became blacke as a cole, and ſmote his forhed for angre and after ſaid, Reinawd thou yong boye voide out of my preſence.

Syr ſaid Reinawd it wer not reaſon. But ſith that it is ſo ferre come that ye will not heere vs: we ſhall keep our peace.</p>
            <p>THus lefte the foure ſonnes of Aimon the debate and ſpake no more to the kyng Charlemayn for that tyme of this matter. Fayre was the courte, and the day was ful fayre and bryghte, and fayre was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> companye as of .xv. kinges .xxx. du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and .lx. erles. They went to the chirch for to heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire maſſe that was ſonge, and muche rych was the offeryng.

And the .xv. kynges were all ſet, except the king Salamon that ſerued that daye with the Duke Godfraye. But Reynaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de at thys dynner myght not eat by cauſe that the kynge Charlemayne had rebuked hym ſo ſhamefully. Ha ſaide Reynawde to hymſelfe Alas, howe ſhall I conne doo ſo muche that I may auenge my ſelfe of Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne for the death of my vncle, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo much was beloued, whiche traito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſly and ſhamefully hath be ſlain? &amp; if I take not vengeaunce of it. I ſhal wexe mad. In this wiſe ſorowed the good Reinawd, and his brethern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted him. The baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s came out after diner for to play &amp; ſporte theym ſelfe, and Berthelot the neuewe of Charlemayn called Reynawd for to play with him, wherof grew a great miſcheef for afterward many a good knight died therfore &amp; manye a fayre childe fatherles as here after ye ſhal herken well.</p>
            <p>NOwe was ſet Berthelot and the worthy Reynawde for to playe at the ches whiche were of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory, wherof the boord was of golde maſſy, and ſo longe they played that debate fel betwene them two, by ſuch maner that berthelot called Reinaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de horſonne, and tooke vp his hand, and ſmote Reynawde in the vyſage ſo that the bloud fell to the grounde, and whan Reynawde ſawe himſelf thus ſhamefully outeraged: he was ryght wroth and ſore angred &amp; ſware by god him ſhould yl betyde therfore. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tooke Reinawd the ches boord and ſmote Berthelot vpon his head ſo harde that he cloued hym to the teeth, and thus Berthelot fell down deade to the grounde afore hym, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan the crye at that houre ſore ſtrong in the Palays that Reynawde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Aimon had ſlain Berthelot the neuewe of kyng Charlemayn. Whan the kynge vnderſtoode thys: he went nyghe oute of his wyt, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of heyghte. Barons keep well that Reinawd ſcape not. For by ſaint
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:7017:20"/> Denis of Fraunce: he ſhall not eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe quicke yf we maye holde hym, for he hath ſlaine our neuew Berthelor. Than ran ſoone the knightes vpon Reinawde. And his kynneſmen defended him nobly. And thus was there greate ſtryfe and manye heres pulled, and many gownes toren. For ſuche a fray was there neuer ſeen as that daye was in the palays of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys. Many ſtrokes gaue there Maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gys the coſin of Reinawd, and ſonne to the duke Benes of Aygremount. And while that this fraye was in the palays: Reinawde and his three bretherne, and theyr coſyn Mawgys eſcaped redyly out of the palays and came vnto theyr horſes that ſoone were made redye.

            <p>ANd whan themperour Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine wyſt that Reinawd and his bretherne were gone oute of Parys: he made for to be redy wel two thouſand knightes for to folow them. Now keep them our lorde that on the croſſe ſuffred paſſyon. For yf the kynge holde them: they ſhall dye withoute remyſſyon, but Reinawde vpon hym is no care. For he was vpon his horſe bayard that goeth as the wynde. So taryed not the foure brethern &amp; theyr coſyn tyll that they came vnto Sawmore, and they bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theyr horſes of Alarde, Richard and of Guycharde. Thanne began Reynawde to make ſorowe ſayinge. Fayre god that ſuffred deathe and paſſyon, keep thys daye my brethern and my coſyn from the deathe, and from combraunce, and from fallinge in the handes of Charlemayne the cruell, and of the other parte chaſed them the frenchemen brochyng with the ſpurres as faſt as theyr horſes myght renne, ſo muche that a knight that was better horſed then the other were: ouertooke Reynawde and ſayd to hym, ye ſhall abyde ye vntrue knyghte and I ſhall brynge you to kinge Charlemayne. And whan Reinawde heard hym: he turned bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde ayenſt hym and ſmot the knyght with his ſpere in his ſheeld, &amp; rought him with ſo great a might that ſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke deade he ouerthrewe him. So ſeaſed Reinawde the knyghtes horſe and tooke him to his brother Alarde that lyghted anon vpon the backe of him. And after that he was on this good horſe: he went &amp; ſmote a nother kny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght with his ſwerd ſo that he made him fall deade afore him, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke this knightes horſe to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Guicharde that thanked hym muche for it. And a nother knighte of the kynge Charlemayne came to theym. Glotons ſayd the knighte ye ſhall come to the king that ſhal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke you al for to be hanged. Ha by my fayth ſaid Reynawd thou ſhalt lye, and with this Reinawd tooke vp his ſwerd &amp; gaue him ſuche a ſtroke that he ouerthrew him dead at the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, than tooke Reinawd the horſe by the reyne and gaue hym to his brother Rycharde that great need had of it. Now be the three brethern new hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; Reinawd is vpon bayarde and his coſin Mawgis that he loued ſo

Than was the ſonne gone vnder, and the nyght began to come, and the foure brethern &amp; their coſyn were come into the towne of Soiſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>SO much rode Reynawd by nyght and by daye vpon bayarde that bare him and Mawgis his coſyn: that they came to Dordon there they met with the ducheſſe theyr mother, that ranne for to kyſſe them and colle them. And ſyn aſked what they had doon of theyr father and if they were departed from the courte with wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the?

And whan the ladye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode him: ſhe felle downe all in a ſwoune, and Reynawd tooke her vp redely.

            <p>REynawd, his three bretherne &amp; Mawgys wolde make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne other ſoiournynge: but tooke ſo muche of the hauoyre and treaſoure of theyr father and mother: that they had ynough of it. And thenne tooke theyr leue of their lady mother, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was great pytie at the depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinge.

            <p>WHan the barons vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the prayer that the emperoure Charlemaine made to them: they anſwered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one voice.

And whan the kynge Charlemayne ſawe them: he receyued them gladly, and in continent without anye taryinge he departed out of Parys, &amp; went with al his hoſte to Mountiyon a towne of his, and there he laye that nyght.

Than went Naymes, and Ogyer and made theym ready, and whan they were ready: they tooke in theyr handes braunches of Olyue tree for to ſhew that they were meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and ſo went they both togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without any other company, &amp; whan Alays that kept watche ſawe that two knights come: he went &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked theym what knightes they were that came there.

And whan he had ſaid this word he made his trompettes to be blowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to call his men together.</p>
            <p>WHan the Emperour Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſawe this greate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that the foure ſonnes of Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dyd to hym: he cryed wyth a hye voyce.

For I ſwere vpon all Sayntes that theyr caſtell ſhall neuer be taken but by famiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, for they ben ouer good knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes preu and wiſe &amp; well aduiſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warre. Whan the barons of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne heard this commaundement they ſayd, ſyr we ſhall do your wyl, &amp; as they wolde haue departed: came Reynawde ſpurring hys horſe, and his brethern, &amp;c we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſmote vpon the folke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour ſo ſharply: that he departed them ſo well, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſte needes flee &amp; take theyr pauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and ſo bode wyth them pryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Anthony Guyemaulte the erle of Neners, &amp; Theirri of Normandi for no man myght endure agaynſte Reynawde and his brethern.

And whan they were aſſembled: Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and his bretherne retourned
<pb facs="tcp:7017:28"/> gladly into theyr caſtel. And was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the hindermoſte man for to kepe his folke the better that led pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners afore, Then came Aymon theyr father afreſſhe vpon them and began to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great comprau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and whan Reynawde ſawe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for to haue waxed mad for angre, ſo retourned he bayarde &amp; ſmote the horſe of his father ſo hard that he fell downe dead to the erth. For as of his father he wolde not touche, and whan Aymon ſaw him ſelfe a grounde: he roſe vp quickelye vpon his feete and tooke his ſwerde in his hande, &amp; began ryght well to defende himſelfe. But his defence ſhould haue ben full lytle worthe to him, for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue take him for theyr priſoner yf it had not ben Ogier the Dane that cam &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured hym. And than ſayde to hym the ſayd Ogyer. Syr what ſemeth you of your children, they be ryght cheualrous and hardy as ye may ſee and knowe.</p>
            <p>WHan Aymon was horſed agayne: he purſued his children as a man wroth &amp; out of his wit, and ſaid to his folke Now goe we after the glotons, for if they lyue longe: they ſhall do vs har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and domage ſo great that wyth payne it ſhalbe recouered. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſaw his father that folowed them ſo ſharply: he turned Bayarde and we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſmote amonge the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of his fathers folke and began to hurt them ſo ſore with the help of his brethren, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he put them to flight maugre their teeth. For they might no longer endure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great maugre y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> Reynawde bare to them, for to ſaye the trouth: no harneys was nought worthe agaynſt the ſwerde of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde.

            <p>ANd whan themperour Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne ſawe this hye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe that Reynawde made: he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hymſelfe of the great meruayle that he had therof, and ſo ſtronge he ſpurred his horſe that he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt Reynawde, and than he ſayd to him Reynawde I forbyde you that ye go no ferther. Whan Reynawde ſaw the kyng: he made to hym reuerence and than withdrew himſelf abacke. And ſayd to hys men, let vs goe fourth, for here cometh the kynge. I wolde not for nothing in this worlde that any of you ſhould laye hande vpon hym. Whan the folke of Reynawde vnderſtode theſe wordes: they put theyr ſwerdes in theyr ſhethes and went agayne vnto theyr caſtel right glad of theyr fayre auenture y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was happend to them that daye. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they were within theyr Caſtell of Mountaynforde: they made the drawe brydge for to be drawen vp, &amp; went and vnarmed them and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the ſupper redy, and ſo they ſet them ſelfe at the table. And there was a great mainy of priſoners. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei had eaten and dronken their fil Reynawde came to hys brother and thanked hym muche with al his hert of that he had ſlayne the erle of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tampes.</p>

            <p>ANd whan themperour Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne ſaw that Renawde was with in his Caſtell: he lighted downe from his horſe into his tente and ſware by god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould neuer departe from thence vnto the tyme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould haue the foure ſonnes of Aymon or that the caſtell were take. ¶ What ſhall I tell more? them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Charlemayne lay well .xiiii. monethes at ſyege afore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> caſtell of Mountaynforde, and there was no weke, but they had a batayle or a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myſhe, &amp; I tell you that Reynawde was not ſo ſore beſyeged, but that he went to chaſe in woodes and in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers as often as hym pleaſed. And dyuerſe tymes it happed that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſpake wyth the Frenche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of trayte the one to the other, ſayinge thus to them. Fayre Lordes I pray you that ye ſpeake to the Emperour Charlemayne &amp; tel hym that he ſhal neuer take vs by no force, for our ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtell is right ſtronge and well garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But know the kynge one thing that whiche he may haue by good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he need not make by force. He may haue the caſtell and vs alſo yf it pleaſe hym in ſuch maner as I ſhal tell you. Whan I ſhal put in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the caſtel of Mountaynforde my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne and my ſelfe, our goodes and bagage ſaufe, &amp; that the warre take an ende that hath laſted ſo longe? he may be well content. Reynawde ſaid Ogier the Dane ye ſay wel and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, &amp; I promyt you I ſhall ſhew the ſame to the kinge as ye haue ſayd, &amp; yf ye will beleue my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell: I enſure you I ſhall tell hym that ye doo ſo for ye are not folke for to be ſet lytel by thus, nor for to be for the courte, for yf the kinge had you nyghe him, he ſoulde be the better for it.</p>
            <p>ALl thus as Reynawde &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier ſpake together, there ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Forques of Morillon that cried to Reynawde vaſſayle yee be but a tool, for certes I haue heard youre wordes well, ye ſhall leue vs Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I know well all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Emperour Charlemain wyll to me, is becauſe I haue ſlayne Berthelot his neuew with a Cheſſe borde of whome god haue mercye.</p>
            <p>Certes I could not doo therto, but I was full ſory for it god wot it, It is trouth whan we played together we had ſome wordes, by whyche with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wordes he gaue me ſuche a ſtroke vpon my face that the bloud ranne downe at the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

So defended I my ſelfe to my power. For who let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hym ſelfe to be ſlayne his ſoule ſhal neuer haue pardon. And thou knoweſt wel Foulques y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I dyd was in my defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng. But to this muſt be made ſhorte wordes, and if it pleaſe you, ye ſhal tel to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king charlemain that he taketh vs to mercy, and that we may be freendes. And yf ye doo thys: ye ſhall doo your honoure.</p>
            <p>For as ſoone may ye be ſlayne there as a nother. Than ſayde Foulques by god all thys is nought worth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Foulques ſayd Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ye threten to muche, it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth not to you for to threten kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes ſo muche that ben better than you, and yf ye haue ony thyng vpon your hert: doo it wythout any more wordes, for I tell you well that ye purchace your death. And whanne Reynawde had ſayd theſe wordes: they wente agayne to theyr pauyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And thus abode the hoſte vnto than without any fyghtyng, but the frechemen came agayn wolde they or not, wherfore the kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne was wrothe.</p>
            <p>THan the Emperour Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſent for men through all hys lande, and whan they were all come: he ſayd to them.

And Mountaynforde is ſo ſtronge: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bi ſtrength it can neuer be taken, but by famyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyng. Now tell me what I ought to doo? for I ſhall doo therin your counſell, whan the barons heard the complaynt that the kynge made to them of the foure ſonnes of Aymo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: there was none ſo hardy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> durſt ſay a worde, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naymes of Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiere that ſayd to the king.

And whan y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> newe tyme ſhalbe come: ye ſhal mow come agayne to lay your ſyege afore Mountaynforde. For I doo you to vnderſtond y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Reynawde is not ſore preſed, but that he goeth in wodes &amp; in riuers at all tymes that he wyl. And a man that may goe out and in at his wil: is not ouer ſore beſieged. And of the other parte Reynawde and hys bretherne are ſuche knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that they ſhall not be lyghtly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. This is my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel ſyr who knoweth a better: let hym tell.</p>
            <p>THen ſpake Hornier of Sauey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, and to him ſaid, ſyr I ſhal gyue you a better counſell yf ye wil beleue me, gyue me the caſtell and al the hauoyre that is with in and the Lordſhyp fyue myles aboute it: and I ſhall yelde to you Reynawde and al his brethern for pryſoners afore a moneth cum to an ende. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal we goe into Fraunce for to ſee oure wyues and children. Hernyer ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng, ye haue ſayd well and wyſely yf ye may doo thys that ye haue ſaid, I graunt to you the caſtell and all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye haue aſked with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame.

But knowe you that Hernyer dyd myſſe of his enterpryſe, for he kept not couenaunt to the kynge as he had promiſed him: for Reinawde tooke hym and made hym to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen all in peces, and made all they that were wyth hym whan he made the treaſon to be hanged and ſlayne, as more playnly ye ſhall vnderſtand here after, yf that ye lyſte to harken.</p>

            <p>HErnier of Saueyn made none other taryenge, but he ſayd to kyng Charlemayne in this maner.</p>

Whan he had ſayd this: he went to hys tente, &amp; made hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe to be armed. And whan he was armed: he lyghted a horſbacke, and rode to the gate of the caſtell, &amp; ſayd to them that kepte warde. Alas for god fayre lordes haue mercye of me if it pleaſe you let me in, or els I am but dead, for the Emperour Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne maketh to folow and ſeke me all aboute, for to make me dye by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe I haue ſaid to him much good of Reynawde, &amp; alſo I tell you wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhall ſhew to Reynawde a thing wherof he ſhall he ryght glad yf hys pleaſure is to heare me.</p>
            <p>WHan they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were aboue v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate heard hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak thus they without lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeng let goe downe the draw bridge and made him come in, &amp; dyſaimed him &amp; did to him great honour. But the falſe traytour rewarded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> full yll for it after that. This hangyng: Charlemayne commaunded Guion to make him redy, &amp; a thouſand kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes with him, and ſent them vpon the hylle, without makyng of anye bruyte tyll that the day were come.</p>
            <p>And wyt that Guyon had wyth hym of the beſt Knyghtes of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne.</p>
            <p>NOw is Harnyer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> traytour within the caſtell of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynforde, vnto whome men made good cheere. And whan Reynawde wyſte that a knight of Charlemayn was come: He ſayde that he wolde ſpeake w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym. And ſo he was brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght afore hym. And whan he ſawe him: he ſayd to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What be you fayre knighte that are come hither? And he anſwered, ſyr my name is Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier of Saueyne, &amp; I haue angred kinge Charlemayne for the loue of you and for this cauſe I am com hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praying that ye haue me for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, for I wot not whether to goe nowe.

            <p>For of ſuche goodes that God hath ſent me ye ſhall not fayle. Now tell me I pray you how doth the hoſte of the Emperour? Haue they anye great plentie fo vytayles. Syr ſayd Hernyer they ben ſcarſe wyth them. But I tell for very certayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhall goe theyr wayts within theſe fourty dayes, for none of the baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wyll no lenger abyde there.

And I promit you yf the hoſte wente awaye ye mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght hurte theym ryght verye ſore, and gette verye muche good, yf ye wyll ſette then vpon the tayle of them. Freende ſayde Reynawde to hym, ye haue comforted me ryght well, yf it is ſo as ye ſay, For yf the king Charlemayne be once ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen: he ſhall not come a nother ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me vpon vs wyth ſo good a wyll as he dooth nowe. And then Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde
<pb facs="tcp:7017:30"/> had hym wyth hym to hys brethern, that made vnto hym good cheere. And whan the ſupper was redy: Reynawde and his bretherne ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe vnto theyr meat and ſupped gladly. And in theyr compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye was the traytour Hernier, vnto whom they made good cheere. After ſupper all the knyghtes wente to ſlepe. For they were wery of beari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of theyr Harneys, and they had not ceaſed to fyght all that day. And wit that Hernier was well and honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to bed. For Reynawde had ſo commaunded. And whan all the knyghtes were faſt a ſlepe: Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier as the falſe Iudas ſlepte not.</p>
            <p>But he roſe and tooke hys harneys and armed hym ſelfe. And whan he was well armed at his eaſe: he came to the drawe bridge, and cut the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that kept it vp, and let the draw brydge go downe, and than he went vpon the walles where he found him that made the watche and ſlew him. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had doone this: he came to the gate and opened it. For he had taken the keyes from hym that he had ſlayne, whyche had them in his kepyng.</p>
            <p>THan whan Guyon of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne ſaw the gate open: he made no tarying, but came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the caſtell, and al hys folke with hym. And began to kylle and flea all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they found. ¶ Now ſhall ye heare of the fayre aduenture how that Reynawde &amp; his brethern were ſaued from this mortall ſlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter.

And Alarde and Richarde heard the noyſe of the horſes, they roſe vp and ſaw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doore of the halle open, and perceyued out of it the harneys y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> glyſtered agaynſt the moone that ſhone full bryght.</p>
            <p>Than went they to the bedde where they had brought the falſe Hernyer, whyche they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not there. Whereof they were ryght ſore abaſſhed. And than was Reynawde awaked, and aſked who was there that maketh thys noyſe. Let our knyghtes take theyr reſt, that haue ſo ſore trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the day it is euyl doone for to go thus ſtampyng at this houre, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cryed Alarde to Reinawde and ſayd. Fayre brother we ben betrayed, for Hernyer that falſe knyght hath put the folke of Charlemayne within thys caſtell, the whiche kyll and ſlea your folke and put them to a greate matter, whan Reynawde vndeſtode this: he made no taryi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but he aroſe and armed hymſelf quickly, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto his brethern and to his men, Now my freendes let vs beare our ſelfe worthy, we had neuer ſo great need, any wyt that Reynawde had w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym but .xxx.

            <p>This hanging: Reynawde &amp; his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern had armed themſelfe right wel hopynge for to defende theymſelfe well.</p>

            <p>THan came Hernyer the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ſteryng about throughe the mayſtres ſtrete &amp; with him well an hundred knightes.

            <p>Whan Reynawde ſaw that he was ſo taken wyth fyre: he was ſore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred and ſayd to hys brethern what ſhall we doo here? for yf we tary any lenger we ſhall all be brent or taken and yf it were not the fyre that thus warreth agaynſt vs: I make myne a uowe to god that we ſhould yet caſte this folke out of thys caſtell, but ſyn that the fyre is in it: we cannot kepe it no lenger. And than he ſayd to his bretherne, come all after me &amp; they went to the fauſebray that was all wayes open, and yſſued out he &amp; his brethern &amp; his folke with them, and whan they were out: than were they more abaſſhed than they were afore for they wyſt not whether to goe.</p>
            <p>Now heare how they dyd as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knightes. For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw the caſtell brenne: they entred wythin a pyt that was there vnder the erthe, for feare of the fyre &amp; ſet the dore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, &amp; there they began to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d themſelfe ſo ſtrongly: that none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred therein but he loſt anon hys head. And whan Hernyer the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour was aware of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: he tooke his folke with him &amp; came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pyt &amp; began to aſſayle Reynawde ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and his brethern, and al they that were therin with them, &amp; wyt it that there at thentre of the ſayd pyt were made great faytes of armes for they of within defended themſelf ſo wel: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none myght come in but he were dead anon. ¶ Whyle that the foure ſonnes of Aymon were in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pyt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therthe: they hearde the crye that his men made, the whiche Hernyer made to be ſlayne. Than began Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde to ſai to his brethern. Lordes let vs go ſuccour our folke, for and they ſhould thus dye: it were to vs a great blame. Syr ſayd hys bretherne goe in goddes name whan it pleaſe you, and whan they were come out of the pitte: the batayle began to be there ful terryble, for ye ſhould haue ſeen Reynawde &amp; his brethern gyue there great ſtrokes and manye. For Reynawde ſmote ſo merueyllouſe ſtrokes wyth hys ſwerd Flamberge the whyche did cut al that he rought. For Reynawde was all wrothe, and for great angre he habandoned and Ieoparded both lyfe and gooddes.</p>
            <p>And therefore he bare greate hurte and harme to hys enemyes, For he had caſt hys Sheelde ouer hys backe, and helde his ſwerde Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge wyth both his handes &amp; made
<pb facs="tcp:7017:31"/> ſo great deſtruccion of the folke of Charlemaine: that the place was al full of bloud. And whan Reynawde ſaw that theyr enemyes were ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſhed, and that they durſte not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde him: he ſayd to his brethern. It was to vs great cowardnes to hyde vs ſo. Syr ſayd Alarde ye ſay trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the. Than ſayd Reynawde. My Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des my brethern let vs to doo well. For traitours ben good to ouercom they ſhall not now endure longe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt vs. And whan he had ſayde theſe wordes: he came to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtel, and the fyre was a lytle quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and maugre al his enemyes he ſhee the gate of that doungeon, and had vp the draw bridge of the ſayde caſtel. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had doone this: he came agayne to the batayle, &amp; found his brethern that ſlewe and beate downe ſo many knyghtes, and bare themſelfe ſo worthelye: that it was maruayle for to ſee. For they ſmote no ſtroke, but they ſlew a man.</p>
            <p>THan was Hernyer the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in the medle within the doungeon, whereof Reynawde had locked the gate, and drawen the brid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge, and the good Reynawde ſaw that he was ſafe of the hoſte of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and began to put hymſelfe in the medle ſo ſharpely that he dyd ſo muche he and hys brethern: that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> folke of Charlemayne that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re wythin the dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geon abode of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue but Hernier and .xii. other, and whan Reynawde ſaw that they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re all dead: he and hys bretherne and hys folke tooke Hernyer and the .xii other. And than Reynawde did doo make agybet vpon one of the hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt towres, and there he made to be hanged the .xii. men. And made Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier to be bound his foure membres that is to wyt, feete and handes to foure horſe tayles. And ſo he was drawen all quicke and quartered in foure peeces, as a traytour ought to be doone vnto. And whan Hernier was dead: Reynawde dyd make a great fyre, and made hym to be caſt therein, and as he was al together brent: he made the aſſhes of hym to be caſt in the ayre to the wynde.</p>
            <p>¶ And heere ye may ſee how the tray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tours that wolde betraye Reynawde were dead and ſlayne. For they were punyſſhed as they had deſerued.</p>
            <p>THan whan king Charlemayne wyſt that his folke were thus dead, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould not haue Reynawde nor his brethern: he was ſore angry therfore, and ſayd to him ſelfe. Ha good God lorde how am I euyll dealed wythall by this foure knyghtes bretherne, I dyd my ſelfe great harme, whan euer I made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knyghtes. And it is often ſayd, that men make often a rod for them ſelf. And that I may well nowe take to me. For theyr vncle ſlewe my ſonne Lohyer, and Reynawde my neuewe Berthelot that I loued ſo deerelye, and yet nowe he hath hanged my men and many of them ſlayne. Well I myght call my ſelfe vnhappye, whan I that am the moſte puyſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the worlde, cannot auenge me of the foure ſymple knyghtes. I ſhall
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:7017:31"/> neuer departe from hens till that I be auenged, or els they ſhal ouercom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me, and all mine armye. Syr ſayde Folques of Morillo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye haue a good cauſe why, and Reynawde is a foole that he fereth you not. For if he had doubted you: he ſhould not haue han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged your men, but he hath doone ſo in diſpyte of you. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke Naymes of banyer, had ye beleued me: ye ſhould not haue loſt your men ye wolde beleue Hernier, it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of it as ye ſee. Now beholde your folke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ben ſhaking with the winde.</p>
            <p>ANd whan the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne vnderſtoode this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the duke Naymes ſayde to hym: He knew that he ſayd trouth, and wyſte not what he ſhould ſay to it, but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked downe all aſhamed. This han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: Reynawde &amp; hys brethern are gone vpon the walles, and looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute them and ſawe that the baſe courte of the caſtell brenned there as their vitailes were. Then began rey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde to ſay to his bretherne, fayre lordes the thinge goeth well, ſyth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ben ſcape thanked be god from ſo perillous and harde auenture. It lacked lytle but that we were al dead by falſe treaſon, but the worſte that I ſee: is that we haue loſte our ſtore of vitayles ſo that we haue nothing to liue vpon, and me ſemeth that yf we dwell anye lenger heere within: we doone not wyſely. But yf it ſeme you good, it is tyme that we departe hence. Brother ſaid Alarde, ye ſpeke well and wyſely, and we ſhall doo as ye haue ſayde. For as longe as the lyfe is in our bodyes: wee ſhall not leue you. Whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure brethern were together accorded for to depart thens: they truſſed al theyr harneys, and taryed tyl that it was night, and than they armed themſelf, &amp; lyghted on horſebacke, And whan they were redy: Reynawde ſayde to them, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des how many men ben we? We ben anſwered Alard well .v. hundred, It is ynough ſayd Reynawde. But wot ye what we ſhal doo? let vs keep ourſelfes alwayes together without makynge of anye affraye and ſo goe thorough the lande of Almayne, and yf the folke of Charlemayne hap to aſſayle vs: thynke to defende ourſelf well and ſmyte harde vpon them ſo that we haue to our worſhip the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, whan it was tyme to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght on horſebacke: Reynawde mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon Gayarde, and the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lyghted vpon theyr horſes. And whan they were all horſed: they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the gate, and wente out at theyr leyſer wythout makynge any noyſe. And whan they were all yſſued out: Reynawde behelde and ſaw the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brente, wherof he tooke greate pitie, and ſayd. Ha god good caſtel it is great domage that ye be thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troied and waſted, goddes curſe haue he that betrayed this good caſtel. It is a goe ſeuen yere that ye were made fyrſte. Alas we haue had there in ſo muche good and ſo mykyl worſhyp: and nowe we leue you mawgre vs. Certes ye were my truſte after my brethern. And whan I muſte leeſe you: there is none ſo ſory for it as I am. And as he ſpake theſe wordes: the teres fell downe from his eyen,
<pb facs="tcp:7017:32"/> and he was ſo taken with greate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynes that almoſte he fell downe in a ſwoune ſo muche of ſorowe he had in his herte.</p>
            <p>ANd whan Alarde ſawe Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſo full of ſorowe: he came to hym and ſayd. By my fayth brother ye be to blame to ſay ſo, ye be not the man that ſhall come to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. For all the knightes that ben a lyue are not worthe you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you that ye wyll confort yourſelfe, for I ſwere you vpon all halowes that afore two yere be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: ye ſhall haue a Caſtell that ſhall be worthe ſuche foure as this is, but now let vs put our ſelfe to the waye for we haue no need to tari. Brother ſayd Reynawde I haue founde euer in you good counſell. Now goe we than our way, and take you &amp; Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde the forewarde, and I and Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde ſhall come behinde. Syr ſayd Alarde all ſhall be doone as ye ſaye. And than tooke Alarde his brother Guycharde with him and wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a. C. knightes with them and had forthe theyr caryage in the myddes of theim. And Reynawde &amp; Rycharde came after with the reſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of theyr folke, but they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make nor paſſe ſo ſoftli, but that the folke of the hoſte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperoure ouertooke them.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>THan whan Charlemayne kne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we we that Reynawde came: he was muche wrothe, &amp; made his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demente that euery man ſhould be armed, &amp; than the hoſte began to moue and went incontinent and armed themſelfe. whan Alarde and Guycharde that wente afore ſawe that they myght not paſſe, but that they muſt medle: they ſpurred their horſes &amp; ranne vpon Charlemayns folke ſo ſharpely that they were all an angred with it, for thei ouerthrew two knightes to the grounde and in continent was there greate a doo.</p>
            <p>And whan Reynawde ſawe that the hoſte moued: he called to hym twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty knyghtes and bad them take and lede foorthe the caryage afore out
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:7017:32"/> of the hoſte, &amp; he ſhould go helpe hys bretherne, ſyr ſayd they we ſhall doo your commaundemente. And than Reynawde ſpurred Bayarde and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred amonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thickeſt, and began there to make ſo great meruayles of armes that all the folke of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine wondred vpon, for he and his bretherne ouerthrew there dead ſo many knightes that none durſt com afore them, but he was ſlayne.</p>
            <p>¶ What ſhall I tell you? wyt it that the folke of king Charlemayne was ſo diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fited for bicauſe that it was nyght, and myght not well ſee what nombre of folke the foure bretherne were, that Reynawde and hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany paſſed mawgre them of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoſte And alſo I tel you for certayne that Reynawde and hys brethern dyd ſo great harme to the folke of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne: that he was ſory for it mani dayes after. whan Reynawde was paſſed: he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ſommers and his caryage, and his Knightes that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duyte them, wherof he was glad.</p>
            <p>Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayde to his brethern. Syrs go on your waye, and they dyd hys commaundement, and Reynawde wyth his brother Rycharde abode behynde, and whan Charlemayne wyſte that Reynawde went a way: he was glad by cauſe he had left the Caſtell of Mountaynforde, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent he made hym to be folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, and alſo the hoſte was redelye armed, and whan they were well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed: they tooke theyr way after the foure ſonnes of Aymon.</p>
            <p>NOw ben the foure knyghtes bretherne ryght ſory of that they haue thus left theyr fayre caſtel of Mountaynforde, and wit it that Charlemayne folowed them well of nyghe, and ſayd that it ſhould hurt him ſore, but yf he might take them. But Reynawde the worthy knyght is not abaſſhed, but he taketh all his folke and ſetteth them afore hym, &amp; ſayde to hys brother Alarde, Good brother Alarde, take kepe of thys folke betwene you and Guicharde, and yf the folke of Charlemayne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle vs: we ſhal defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs wel. Syr ſayd Alarde as ye haue ſayd: ſo ſhall it be doone. And than they ſaw come Charlemayne and Ogyer the Dane the duke Naymes of bauiere, Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Moryllon, and many other and whan Charlemayne that came afore well horſed ſaw Reynawde &amp; his folke: he cryed to them and ſayde So helpe me god glotons ye be now dead, this is the day y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhall make you all foure to be all hanged. Syr anſwered Reynawde it ſhall not be ſo as ye wene, and it pleaſe God, for yf god gyue me lyfe and health, and to my horſe Bayarde, the purſucte ſhall ſore dere be bought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye nowe doo. And whan he had ſayd the ſame he turned Bayarde agaynſt Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne for to ſmite him. For he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de well to haue ſlayne him wythout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faute. The kynge Charlemayne was in daunger to dye yf Reynawde had raught hym, but Dampe hughe wente betwene the kynge and Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde that came with hys ſpere in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt wylling for to doo great harme And at this coming: he ſmote Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe hughe thorough the ſheelde ſo har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de that he perced his herte wyth the
<pb facs="tcp:7017:33"/> Iron of his ſpere, and ſo he fell downe dead afore the kynge. And whan Reynawde had gyuen that ſtroke he wente hys waye after hys brethern.</p>
            <p>WHan Charlemaine ſaw hughe fall dead: he cryed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an highe voyce: Now after lordes after, for if theſe glotons ſcape vs: I ſhal neuer be mery, &amp; Reynawde came agayne to hys folke and ſayd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Lordes doubt you not as longe as I am a lyue, but be al aſſured and ſo ryde on hardly and in good araye. ¶ What ſhall I tell you more? Wyt it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .xxiiii myle laſted the chaſe, and there was neuer a myle: but that they iuſted to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, &amp; many knightes were there ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſlayn. But Reynawde and his folke bare themſelf ſo ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly that they loſt, but three of theyr fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawſhip at that tyme, but they rode ſo longe tyll that they came to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The kynge called to him his ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rons and ſayd to them: Lordes let a loue the chaſe, it were foly from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s forth on for to folow them, for I ſee in al our horſes may no more let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe to a hundred thouſand deuyls, for yf Reynawde wrought with wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch craft he could doo no more, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth. Let vs thinke for to lodge vs heere nyghe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryuer. For the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey is good and pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt as me ſemeth Syr ſayd the barons, let it be doone as ye haue commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Than they vnladed theyr ſommers, and pyght there their pauyllions. And whan they were ſet vp: the king made him to be dyſarmed. And in the meane whyle the ſupper was made redye lyghtlye, for all the daye the king had nother eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor none of hys felowſhyp. And Reynawde was paſſed ouer the riuer he and his bretherne, and his folke ſafe &amp; ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where as they wolde be by the grace of our Lorde, and whan Reynawde and his brethern ſaw that the chaſe was ceaſſed and left: they went all ſoftly, and whan they had gone ferre from the oſte of king Charlemayne: they found a fountayne fayre and cleare, and aboute that fountayne was muche fayre graſſe and thicke. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde ſaw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place was ſo pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: he ſayd to hys folke. Heere is a fayre ground for to lodge vs &amp; for our horꝭ, Sir ſaid Alarde, ye ſay trouth. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vnladed theyr ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers and theyr cartes, and wyt it the horſe were wery, but the poore knyghtes were euyl lodged, for they had there no meate nor drynke but cleare water. But wyt it that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde nor none of his knightes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed them not, but made good wat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che all the nyght one after another. And whan they ſaw the daye come: Reynawde made hys harneys to be truſſed, and they lyghted horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and tooke theyr way through the great foreſt of Ardeyne, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had riden longe they lyghted do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wne afore another fountayne that they that had watched the nyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould reſt themſelfe there.</p>
            <p>NOw myght well ſay Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can neuer hurte the foure ſonnes of Aymon. And
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:7017:33"/> wit that he was lodged vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer where he abode, whan he wolde no more folow after Reynawde, and whan the day was clere: he ſayde to the duke Naymes. What thynke ye what we ought to doo? Syr ſayd the duke Naymes yf ye wyll beleue me: wee ſhall tourne backe agayne. For to goe any ferther this waye: it were but a foly, for thys wood is to thick and the riuer ouer muche perillous &amp; alſo Reynawde &amp; his brethern are ſuche knyghtes that they be not for to belyghtly ouerthrowen, &amp; while the king and the duke ſpake together there came many knyghtes to hym, and whan Charlemayne ſaw them: he called Vydelon, Reynier, Ogier y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dane and ſayd to them. Lordes I will that ye come agayne to parys wyth me. And whan they vnderſtode this: they were glad and ſayd to the King, Sir it is the beſte counſell that ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo, and after that thei were ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Charlemayne made to be cryed that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould returne agayn into his countrey, &amp; that they ſhould kepe it well, &amp; that he prayed theym ſo to doo. Syr ſayd the barons wee ſhall doo your commaudement, and whan all was ſayde: they made the hoſte to deſcende &amp; take theyr way, &amp; the king went ſtreyght to paris and the barons in theyr countryes, and whan Charlemayne was come to Paris: he called afore him his baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; to them ſayd, fayre lordes I am y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte vnhappy kyng of the worlde, whan I haue no power to auenge my ſelfe of the foure ſonnes of Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and they led me as ye know. I wene they ſhall returne into theyr countrie or to theyr caſtell, and it be ſo: I wyll y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we go there agayne for to ley ſyege there. Syr ſayd the duke Naymes, that ſhal they not doo, for they are in Ardeyne, And ye knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the foreſt is ſo great that they ſhall fynde ſome cheuyſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. That might wel be ſayd the kyng Charlemayne. But where ſome euer they go: euell way myght they fynde. And whan he had ſayd this: he tourned toward Ogyer, and ſayd to him. Take Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarde, Foulques the Almayne, and Dron of Moudidier, and gyue leaue to the frenche men and to the other. Syr ſayd Ogyer well ſhal be doone your commaundement. And then we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ogier to Foulques, to Gerard and vnto Dron, and tolde them that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Charlemayne had commaunded. And after came to the frenche men, &amp; tolde to the other knyghtes, &amp; gaue them leue. And whan the kynges folke haue had leue: eueri man went to his countrey, not the right waye: But trauerſynge the mountaynes. And thus as Aymon went trauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge the lande towarde hys coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: It happed to him ſo that he came by the fountayne where hys ſonnes dwelled. Whan Aymon ſaw hys chyldren: he was abaſſhed and ryght ſory for it. And then he ſayd to his barons. Lordes counſell me I praye you what I ought to doo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt mi childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For and I aſſayle them, and that they ben ſlayne or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: I ſhall neuer haue Ioye. And I I let them goe: I ſhalbe forſworne to Charlemayne. Whan his barons hearde him ſpeake ſo: there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer one that anſwered anye worde.
<pb facs="tcp:7017:34"/> And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Aymon ſawe that he was counſelled of no man: he ſayd agayn to them. Syth it is ſo that ye wyll gyue me no counſell: I ſhall doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myne owne wyll. For god forbid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it be layde to me, that I haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heere. And haue not fought with them. But well I tell you that it is for my ſynne that I haue founde them here. But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hens forth it ſhal be doone therin as it pleaſeth God &amp; fortune. Syr ſayd Eſmenfraye yf ye aſſayle your children ye doo not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſe for ye ſware it to the kynge Charlemayne, kepe ſyr Aimon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye be not forſworne. For a man of your age ſhould rather dye than he ſhould doo any treaſon. Good freend ye ſay well ſayd Aymon, and I ſhall ſo doe that I ſhal not be blamed, and than he called two of his knightes, and ſayd to them. Go towarde Reinawde and his brethern and defye them in my behalfe. Syr ſayd the knightes it is a harde thinge for to be doone, but ſythe it pleaſe you: we ſhall doo as ye haue commaunded, &amp; than thei wente towarde Reynawde that was ſore abaſſhed, for he knew well that they were of his fathers folke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was full ſory for it. And after he ſayd vnto his bretherne. Lordes now arme your ſelfe. For a man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is well garnyſſhed is not of lyghte ouerthrowen, and of the other ſyde I know ſo muche the hardynes of my father: that he ſhall not feyne to be fyght vs. Brother ſayd Richarde ye ſaw trouthe. Thys hangyng: ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the two knightes afore him, and whan Reynawde ſawe them come nyghe hym: he went agaynſt them &amp; ſaid to them. Lordes what be ye? and what winde driueth you hyther? tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpake one of the knyghtes, &amp; ſayd to Reynawde. Syr we ben knyghtes of my lorde your father that ſendeth to you by vs a defiaunce. Lordes ſayd Reynawde I wyſte it well as ſoone as I dyd ſee you of ferre. But go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne &amp; tel to our father that it wyll pleaſe hym to gyue vs trewce for he ſhall not doo wel for to be fight vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are his naturall childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Syr ſaid the knight of the folye ye ſpeake, but thinke to defende your ſelues well, for he ſhall aſſayle you w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt.</p>
            <p>ANd whan they had ſayd theſe wordes: hey retourned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne for to reherſe to Aymon theyr meſſage, &amp; how they had defyed hys children. Whan the olde Aymon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode them: he made none other tarying but ſpurred his horſe with the ſpurres, and ranne the formaſte vpon hys ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. And whan Reynaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de ſawe his father come: he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and ſaid. Ha father what doo you? we haue none ſo great a foe as ye be to vs, and I haue great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle that ye come alwayes vpon vs, ye doo yll &amp; great ſinne for to doo ſo. At the leaſt yf ye wyll by no wyſe helpe vs: be not to vs contrary ne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy yf it pleaſe you. Thou theefe ſaid Aymon, ye ſhal neuer doo good ſyth that ye begyn to preche. Goe to the wood ſo ſhall ye become wylde beaſtes, euyll day giue you god. For ye ben not worth an handfull of ſtraw Now thynke to defende your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>For yf ye ben taken: ye ſhal be put to a great tourmente. Syr ſayde Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:7017:34"/> ye doo vs wronge. I ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende me ſyth that I mai none other wyſe doo. For yf I ſholde let mi ſelfe to be ſlaine: mi ſoule ſhould be put to paine and tourmente. Whan Aymon ſaw that: he brought his ſpere in the reſt, and put himſelf among his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren, lyke as they had ben ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers And whan Reynawde ſaw that: he cryed to hys men, and ſayd, heere is none other but doo wel now. Lordes thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke to ſmite wel, for need co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelleth vs therto. And whan he had ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde: he ſpurred his horſe with his ſpurres, and put hymſelf in the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt. And began to make ſo great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes of armes, that all the folke of his father meruayled of it greatlye. ¶ What ſhall I ſay? the batayle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſo fell and ſo cruell: that pytie it was to ſee. For ye ſhould haue ſene gyue and receyue great and horrible ſtrokes of the one parte, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and many knightes and horſes dye, many ſheeldes broken and mani white harneys broken. So manye heades ſmittes of and ſo many leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and armes broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſore hurt. And thinke that this batayle was ſore ſtronge and well holden of the one ſyde and of the other. But to ſay the trouth: Reynawde muſt loſe at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme. For hys Father had three ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes as many folke as he had. For of fyue hundred me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that abode with Reynawde after his caſtel was take which were with him at this bataile: were left on lyue, what hurt &amp; ſound but fyfty perſones. But I tell you well for verye certayne that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde &amp; his bretherne dyd ſo great harme to the folke of theyr father: that they ſlew well halfe of the men that he had. But at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt Reynawde muſt loſe and flee away towarde the mountaynes, and Aymon chaſed hym as well as he could, for he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d well for to haue taken theym. and whan Reinawde ſaw them ſelf vpon the toppe of the mountayne: he ſayde vnto his brethern. Let vs not depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence. For this is a good place for to defende. Wyt that there was great ſcarmyſſhi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and iuſtyng made and many a knyght dead and verye ſore wounded. And there was ſlayne vnder Alarde his good horſe. And whan that Alarde ſawe himſelfe a ground: he lept vpon his feete ryght quickli. And tooke his ſwerde in his hande and began for to defende well his bones. And whan that Rychard ſawe his brother Alarde a foote: he turned towarde him for to helpe &amp; ſuccour hym, and Aymon and his folke came there for to take him.</p>
            <p>So began the batayle yet agayne more cruel then it had be afore. And wyt that Alarde ſhould haue ben ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken there, yf it had not be the noble and worthy knyght Renawde that came for to helpe him. And whan that he was come there: he ſmote Bayarde wyth hys Spurres, and wente into the greateſt pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe. So that he ouerthrew the Duke Aymon his father doune vnto the grounde, and after he ſayd vnto hym. Father ye haue pledged my brother Alarde For ye be now ſet a foote as he is.</p>
            <p>Than was Aymon very ſore angry that he loſte almoſt his wittes. And
<pb facs="tcp:7017:35"/> Reynawde ſet his hand to his ſwerde and began for to departe the preſe in ſuche a wiſe that he brought hys bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Alarde out of the preſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayd to hym. Fayre brother lepe behinde me vpon Bayarde. For to abyde here any lenger: it were folye. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alarde vnderſtode his brother Reynawde: he was ryght glad for he was ſo wery y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he myght no more and ſo he mounted vpon Bayarde behynde his brother Reynawde. And whan Bayarde wyſte him ſelf lade wyth two knyghtes: he ſtrengthed hymſelf ſo ſtrongly: that it ſemed to Reynawde that he was more Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe and more mery than he had be of al the daye. Now wit it that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde made foure Iouſtes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horſe Bayarde with hys brother A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larde behinde hym. Whereof he ſlewe foure knightes of the folke of Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne that were come with hys father Aymon. And all thus Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde tooke Alarde out of hys ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes handes Mawgre theyr teeth &amp; bare hymſelf right worthely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame day, as here after ye ſhal mow more playnly vnderſtande.</p>
            <p>NOw ben the foure ſonnes of Aymon recreaunt &amp; almoſte wery, but only Renawde that neuer was the weker for nothing that he dyd in armes. For as he went: he tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned himſelfe at euerye paſſe that he made, and rebuked and kept his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes a backe with his harde ſtrokes that he gaue to them, ſo that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke wente afore hym all at theyr eaſe and leyſer. And whan he ſawe that his folke were wel ferre from their enemyes: he ſpurred Bayarde and came to his folke (his brother Alarde behinde hym) as lightly as bayarde had be without anye brydell and no ſadle vpon him. For this horſe was ſuche that he was neuer werye, and thus as Reynawde went away: than cam &amp; folowed after him Eſmenfray y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was one of the moſte worthy kny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes of Charlemayne &amp; was vpon a horſe right good and blacke, that Charlemayne had geuen to hym.</p>
            <p>And whan he was nighe Reynawde he cried to them. So helpe me God glottons ye ben dead or taken ſureli I ſhal brynge you to Charlemayne. And anon we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſmote Reynawde in his ſheelde, wherof Reynawde was muche angry, and Reynawde ſmote him agayne in ſuche a wyſe and wyth ſo great a ſtrength: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his ſheelde nor for his good armures of ſteele he was not kepte, but that Reynawde ouerthrew hym ſterke dead to the grounde. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this knight was dead: Reynawde tooke his horſe by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridell and ſayd to Alard his brother holde fayre bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, light vpon this Blacke Horſe whiche is good. For I gyue him to you.</p>
            <p>ANd whan that Alarde ſawe the fayre preſent that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reynawde had doone to hym: he was as glad of the ſame, as thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghe he had wonne Parys. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made none other rarienge: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he lighted downe from Bayard and mounted vpon Eſmenfrays blacke horſe that his brother had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym &amp; ſmote him with the ſpurres &amp; went
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:7017:35"/> and Iuſted agaynſt a knyght of his fathers folke that was called anfrai ſo harde that he ouerthrew him dead to therthe. And ſhortly to ſpeake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Alarde was in this wiſe ſet agayne on horſe backe: began the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle of a freſhe ſore hard and fell, in ſo muche that at that houre were ſlayne .xx. of the beſt knyghtes that Aymon had with him. Whan Aymo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaw this: he was ſore angry for it, &amp; cryed to hys folke. Halordes yf they ſcape you I ſhal neuer haue ioy, for they haue ſlayne Eſmenfray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good knyght that king Charlemayne had gyuen to me. Whan the folke of Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnderſtode theſe wordes, &amp; the wyll theyr Lorde: than they dyd ren vpon Alarde ſo much that thei made hym to leue the place by force, and if it had not be the paſſage of a lytle ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that eaſed and holye them great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: Reinawde and hys brethern had muche to doo, but I tell you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faute that Reynawde and hys brethern made ſo great occiſyon of that folke of theyr father: that it was pitie for to beholde, for there dyed well of them .xxv. at the paſſage of the ryuer and yf Reynawde had had wyth him a fyfty knightes more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſage: he ſhould haue dyſcomfyted his father and all hys folke but for faute of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Reynawde muſt for ſake the place and myght not ſaue with hym but .xiiii. knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of hys owne. Nowe ſee how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull was the batayle, for of fyue hundred knyghtes that Reynawde had with hym there abode wyth him alyue but .xiii. and ye maye well wit that the olde Aymon had domma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his children right ſore, but that they paſſed ouer the Riuer, for as it is ſayde they had loſte all theyr men wherof they were full ſorye and wrothe.</p>
            <p>¶ Now hath Reynawde ſo fewe fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke that he wot nomore what to doo, but he might not doo therto, wherof the teres fell downe continually fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eyen, and in lykewyſe wept Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hys father at the other ſyde as the hiſtorye dooth tell, and whan he had wept ynough: he ſayd in this maner. Ha fayre Sonne pane and worthye howe ſorye am I? for I am the occaſyon of your harme and domage, now ſhall ye all goe as exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for ye haue nought to lyue vpon &amp; I cannot helpe you by anye wyſe, wherof I enſure you I am greatlye diſpleaſed and ſory for it. The deuil take his ſoule that fyrſt bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtrife &amp; ſo ſhal he. Whan he had made hys mone and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacions longe ynou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe: he made inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent all the dead bodyes to be taken for to be buryed.</p>
            <p>And they that were hurte: he made to be brought wyth hym as well as he coulde, And made the bodi of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menfray to be put vpon a litter, and tooke on his way towarde Ardeyne where he bode but a night, and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mornyng he made the litter to be bor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne vpon two horſes &amp; went agayne to Paris and came afore Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne and ſayd to hym. Syr whan I went now laſt towarde my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, wyt that as I was on my way, I founde my children, and fyue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred knyghtes wyth them in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Ardeyne, &amp; for thacquitaunce of myn othe: I dyd ſend to them mi

And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I aſſailed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it hath coſt me ſore dere, for they haue borne vnto me ſo great harme and domage that it can not be eſtemed, and I ſlew al theyr folke excepte .xii perſones that ben ſcaped with them but they haue ſlayn your knyght Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menfray, but at the laſt they went a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way diſcomfited and ouerthrowen. And they ſhould haue ben taken yf it had not be a ryuer that they paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, wherby they were ſaued. Whan Charlemayne vnderſtode theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: he was ryght ſore an angred, ſo muche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he loſte almoſt his wytte. And than he ſayd to olde Aymon in angre, by God Aymo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye excuſe your ſelfe falſly, for neuer Rauen eate his yonge byrdes, to a nother ye ſhall make thys to beleue but not to me. Whan y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> olde Aymon vnderſtode the kynge that he ſpake thus: he ſayd to hym. Syr Emperour wit that I doo tell you is trouth, and I doo ſhewe it to the ende that my trouthe be kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; for none other cauſe, doo bring afore me your reliques and halowes that I ſhall ſwere vpon the ſayntes that ben in heauen, that it was as I haue recountred &amp; ſayd to you, and yf it pleaſe you ye ſhall beleue me, &amp; yf ye wyll not: ye may chuſe therof. Aymon ſayd Charlemayne I know well your herte, for yf it went all at your wil, your ſonnes ſhould be lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of all Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and of all my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre.

But euermore ye haue be ſuch that ye neuer loued a true knyght, but flateres and liers wherof mani euilles ben happed and ſhall happe. And than Aymon came downe from the Palays, and lygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon hys horſe and went agayn to his countrey without any leaue that he tooke of the kynge, &amp; he rode ſo longe a day after another that he came to Ardeine, and there he found the Ducheſſe his wyfe, that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt hym, and receyued hym with a glad chere, and aſked hym howe he had doone.</p>
            <p>THan ſayde the duke Aymon, ful euyll haue I doone. For I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my foure ſonnes in the wood of Ardeyne, &amp; ſo I aſſayled them cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>elly wenyng to me for to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, whiche I coulde not doo, but I ſtewe &amp; diſcomfited all theyr folke, &amp; they haue doone me ſo great harme of my folke, and ſo many they haue ſlayne of them: that I know not the nombre. And I tell you for very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, but yf it had ben the prowes &amp; great worthynes of our ſonne Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde: I had taken Alarde, for my men had ſlayne his horſe, and had brought hym ſo lowe that he myght no more goe, but Reynawde his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came vpon vs and brake vs ſo ſore that he brought Alarde out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſe, mawgre vs and oure folke, &amp; made hym ſyt behinde hym vpon Bayarde.

And wit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had but eche of them foure an horſe that is to wit Bayarde and the thre other, but they haue nother Otes nor other Corne for to gyue theym, but they eat only ſuch as they might fynde in the foreſt of rootes and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. And for this cauſe: theyr horſes were ſo leane that with peyne might they ſtande, ſaue Bayarde that was fatte and in good plight, for he could better feede and lyue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rootes, than
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:7017:37"/> the other ſhoulde haue doon with hey andotes. And wyt it well that the foure ſonnes of Aymon lyued there this life ſo longe that euery man that paſſed there as they were and kepte theim ſelfe, eſcaped not, but he was other ſlayne or diſtreſſed of ſuche vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cailles as he had, ſo that all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie aboute them was ſore waſted by theim that it was meruaille. And at the laſte the foure knightes were ſo ſore apayred, that they that had ſeene them afore: ſhoulde not haue knowen them, for their harnays was all ruſty and their ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it was no meruayle, for they weared alwayes their cote of mayle all rouſtye vpon their doublettes, and hadde nother ſherte nor Iacket but they were all rotten. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> What ſhal I tel you more? and wyt that Reynawd was douted and feared ſore that it was meruail. For nigh there as Reinawd hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted: was no man that durſt abide there, but onely within the fortreſſes. For whan Reynawd was mounted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bayarde, and his three brethern vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their other three horſes: all their rycheſſe and power was with them, and yet they waſted and deſtroyed all the countrie all about theim. And ſo the foure poore knightes were ſo ſore diſfigured, that who ſomeuer had ſeene them, ſhould not haue knowen them. For they were as roughe as beres that been famyſhed and were ryght ſore lene that euery bodye had of it pytie.</p>
            <p>ANd whan Reynawde ſawe himſelfe ſo porely arayed: he called to him his brethern and ſayde, Lordes I meruayle my ſelfe muche that we take not ſome good counſell what we haue to doo, and me ſemeth that we ben become yl, &amp; that ſlouthe is amonge vs. For yf we were ſuch as I crowed: We ſhoulde not ſuffre the martirdome that we endure and that we haue endured ſo longe a goe, no we know I that we ben but lytel worth to haue let reſte oure enemyes as we haue.

Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two other knightes hearde the couſeil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Alarde their brother had gyue to Reinawde: they began to ſaye.

And ſo longe they rode by nyght and by daye that they came there as they were borne that was nigh the citie of Ardeyn, and whan they were ſo nigh the citie that they myghte well ſee it: they looked vpon it, and they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the greate ryches wherfro thei were caſt and banyſſhed, and of the greate pouertye that they had ſuffred longe. And as they aproched nyghe the cytye. Reynawde ſayde to hys brethern we haue doone euyl that we haue not taken ſuretie of oure father, for ye knowe well that he is ſo cruell that yf he may take vs: he ſhal yeelde vs priſoners to Charlemain. Brother ſaide Rychard, ye ſaye well but my herte gyueth me not that oure father wolde doo as ye haue ſaid, and he ſo dyd: yet haue I leuer die afore Ardeyne: than for greate dyſeaſe and hungre in the foreſt, let vs ryde ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I telle you that no bodye ſhall know vs. And of thother parte if we can ſet oure feet within Ardeyne: we ſhal be ſafe ynough, for we be wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and my laid our mother ſhould neuer ſuffre that men ſhoulde doo to vs any harme ne dyſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>CErtes fayre brother ſaide Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, ye haue ſayde tyght wel and wiſely, and much ye haue recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me. Nowe let vs ryde in a good houre. And whan he had ſayd theſe wordes: they entred ſoone after with in Ardeyne, and they tode thorough the mayſtres ſtreate that they were not knowen of no bodye, &amp; they went ſtreyght to the caſtel without any ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryinge. And wyt that whan they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoroughe the ſtretes: the folke that behelde them, merueylled muche of them, for they wyſte not what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke they were, and ſayd the one to the other, ſee what folke ben theſe.

Syrs anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Reynawde ye enquere ouer much ſee ye not what folke we been. And whan they were come to the palays they lyghted downe a foote, and too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke their horſes to keep to their kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes

For the olde Aymon theyr father was a hawkyng vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp; the ducheſſe their mother was in her chambre, where ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynually pencyful and ſory bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe might not heare no tidinges of her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And whan Alarde ſawe hys lady mother come, he ſaid to his brother Reynawde and to his other brethern, yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der is our mother that we ſore deſyred for to ſee, let vs goe agaynſt her yf it pleaſe you, and tell her our great penurye and oure need. Brother ſayd Reynawde wee ſhall doo ſo, but we ſhall tary tyl ſhe ſpeake to vs or not, and thus taried the foure brethern tyl that theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther was come to them. And whan ſhe ſawe them ſo blacke &amp; ſo hidous, &amp; principally Reynawde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſo great &amp; ſo rough: ſhe tooke ſo greate feare of them that ſhe wolde haue gone agayn into her chambre, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhe aſſured herſelfe &amp; ſaid to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God ſaue you Lordes.

Was there euer Ladye that bare ſo riche a bourden as I haue, and that were of it ſo diſcomforted as I am?</p>
            <p>ANd whan Reynawde ſawe his lady mother ſo ſorowful &amp; ſory: he had of it great pitie, and the teres began to come at his eyen, &amp; wolde dyſcouer himſelfe. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ducheſſe behelde well his viſage and his behauour, and maner: her bloud ranne vp to her face, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered within her body, and began to ſhake full faſt, ſo that almoſt ſhe fel downe in a ſwoune to the erth and was a great whyle that ſhe myght not ſpeake her hert was ſo cloſe and ſo ſore preſſed, &amp; all her coloure loſt and gone, and whan ſhe was come agayne to her ſelfe: ſhe dyd caſte her ſyght agayne vpon Reynawde, and

Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſaid to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as glad as ani mother may be, Reynnawde my ſonne, whoſe peere is not among al the knightes of the worlde.

And while that ſhe ſaid theſe wordes: ſhe looked aboute her, and knew her children, &amp; anon ſhe went towarde them wyth her armes ſpred abrode, for to coile and kiſſe theym ſore weepynge for great pitie that they were ſo ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred of theyr beaultie, and ſo long ſhe kiſſed one and than another: that at laſt ſhe fell downe in a ſwoune.

            <p>ANd whan the ducheſſe was come agayne to herſelfe: ſhe tooke her children &amp; made them ſitte downe by her, and ſayd to them how is it that I ſee you thus poore &amp; dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fygured? why is it that ye haue with you no knightes nor none other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Lady ſayd Reynawde we haue with vs but three knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that keep our horſes yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.

And brynge hither y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> three knightes, that keep the horſes without, for I wyl ſee them. Madame ſayde her ſquyer it ſhal be doone incontinent. And then he went to the three knyghtes and ſayd to them, that the ducheſſe wolde ſee them. Whyche incontinent dyd as the ladye had commaunded, and came to the Palays where as Reynawde taryed for them. Lordes ſaid the ducheſſe to them, ye be right welcome. Madame ſayd the knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes God gyue you good life &amp; longe and Ioye of your children, For they ben the beſt and the moſte worthye knyghtes of all the worlde. Thys hangyng: came there a yeman, that ſayd to the ducheſſe. Madame, yf it pleaſe you to ſit at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meat is redy. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lady tooke Reynawde and the other with her, &amp; lede them to dinner and made them ſyt downe all afore her, and theyr three knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

For it was longe ſyth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had ony good mele, where they myghte take theyr naturall food at theyr eaſe. And as they were at the table: Thenne came theyr father Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon from hawkynge and huntynge whiche had taken foure hartes and two wylde bores, and dyuerſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryches and Feſauntes. Whan Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſawe them: he knewe them not and he ſayd vnto the ducheſſe.

Now are they come vnto me by cauſe I am ryghte glad whan I ſee theym. For to you they ben not come. For they knowe well that ye loue them not, But I praye you for god that for the loue of me ye wyll lodge them this night. For they ſhall departe to morow erlye, &amp; I wot not yf euere I ſhall ſee them. Wherefore of this I beſeeche you right humbly,</p>
            <p>Than whan Aymon vnderſtode theſe wordes: he ſhooke al for anger, and tourned hym ſelfe toward his ſonnes, and made to them euill there and ſaid to them, Gloto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des curſe haue you, For ye ben not worthe a ſtrawe. For ye haue nother folke nor money, nor no priſoner y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might pay to you a great hauoyre. Father ſayd Reynawde by the fayth that I owe to you, if your lande is in peace, the other ben not ſo. For ye might goe ſixe ſcore miles that ye ſhould not finde nother riche man nor poore, but that they keepe them ſelues within fortreſſes and in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelles.

Ye were neuer my childerne: For yf ye were ſuch as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wene: ye ſhould not haue ſuffred the great pouertie that ye haue endured ſo longe.

Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voyde out ſoone of my Palayce, and goe begge where ye wil at a nother place Syr ſayd Reynawde ye ſay that an euyll and an vnkynde father ought to ſaye. For I tell you for very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that we haue ſlayne ſo manye theues and brygauntes: that I can not numbre them, wherof I fele my ſelfe in great ſynne. But for god we requyre you that ye wyll helpe vs to recouer our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of Charlemayn and yf ye wyll not doo ſo: gyue to vs of your godes, and we ſhall goe ferre from you.

I and my brethern haue doone ſo muche, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ben comen into your place, that we ſhould fare the better for it, but I ſee wel ye wyll caſt vs therfro w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great afraye. And I ſwere to you by the fayth that I owe to my Lady mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that yf I muſte nedes departe from you in ſuche a maner: ye ſhall abye it full deere, yf ye caſte vs thus out of your lande, for I haue leuer die here by you, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to die for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre.

And after the kynge tooke hym by the hand and went vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the hall of the palays and ſo forth to the chambre of parements whyche was hanged right rychelye. And than the kyng called for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cheffe for to playe at it with Reynawde, And as they were playing together there came in the olde knyght that had charge of the kinge for to make the mariage of Reynawde, and of the kynges Syſter, whyche knyght was called Godefray of Molins, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was come afore the kyng: he ſayd. Heare lordꝭ what I wil tel you, to nyght as I was in my bed a ſlepe me ſemed that I ſaw Reynawde the ſonne of Aymon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſet hyghe in a chayre and all the people of thys Realme enclyned theymſelfe before him.

And whan Reynawde ſawe that: he lighted vpon Bayarde and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt him and faught with hym &amp; hurted him ſore, and than I woke out of my ſleape, and whan the olde knyghte hadde ſayde ſo: then roſe

For they ſhalbe thus both right well and richely wedded, and than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge anſwered thou haſte ſpoken well and wyſely. Whan the clerke had declared the betokenyng of the dreame of tholde knyght Godfray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng yon ſayd that touchynge thys maryage the thinge was well agrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble vnto hym. And whan Reynawde vnderſtode thys warde: he ſayd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, Syr gramercy of the fayre gift that ye doo to me, but and if it pleaſe you ye ſhal haue a lytle pacyence vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the tyme that I haue counſelled with my brethern &amp; my coſyn maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys. Brother ſayde Alarde ye haue ſayd yll. What refuſe you of the king ſo great a gift as he giueth you now yf ye wyll beleue me ye ſhall fulfyll the kynges wyll incontynent for to me and to my bretherne it ſhall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe well. And whan the king gaue you not his ſyſter but a ſymple Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyſell yet ought you to beleue him and doo after his wyl. Brother ſaid Reynawde, it is not the fyrſte tyme that ye haue giuen to me good coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell and true, and I promyſe you I ſhall doo it ſyth that ye doo counſel me ſo. And than Reynawde turned hymſelfe to warde the king and ſaid to hym. Syr I am all together redye to doo all that ye wyl, and than Rey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde roſe vp and the kynge tooke hym by the hand and made his ſiſter to be affyaunced vnto hym.</p>
            <p>THan wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the maryage was made accorded, &amp; made ſure of the one parte &amp; of thother: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinge yon came to the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his ſiſter, and found her beſy aboute a penoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cel of a ſpere, that ſhe made ful fayre for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight Reynawde but ſhe durſt not tell it. The kynge ſalued her as ſoone as he ſawe her, and the noble mayde roſe vp anon againſt her bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther and made hym due reuerence ryght manerly. Fayre ſyſter ſayd the kynge I haue doo marye you well and hyghlye. Whan the pucell vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtode hym: ſhe began to chaunge her colour and bowed her body to hym, and ſayd no worde of a longe whyle. And whan ſhe had the power for to ſpeake: ſhe ſayd to the kyng her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſyr to whome haue you geuen me. Fayre Syſter ſayd the kynge I haue gyuen you vnto the beſt knight of the worlde, it is Reynawde the ſonne of Aymon the noble knyght &amp; valyaunt. Whan the noble Damoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:7017:48"/> vnderſtode that it was to Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde to whome her brother had ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryed her ſhe was ryght glad of it, for ſhe loued Reynawde of a great loue and ſayd to the kynge. Syr I wyll doo withal my hert your commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and your wyll. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king tooke her by the hand &amp; brought her to the palays, and ſaid to Reynawde afore al his baco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Holde heere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knyght Reynawde I gyue you my ſyſter to your wyfe and ſpouſe.</p>
            <p>Syr ſayd Reynawde a thouſand gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mercyes of ſo fayre a gyft that ye gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue to me preſentlye, for it appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not ſo great a gyft to ſo poore a knyght as I am, than tooke Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde the pucell and fyaunced her, and ſware. And the kynge wolde make no taryeng therat, but tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pucel by the hande, and brought her to the churche well honourably, and the byſhop of Bordews wedded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And whan Reynawde had his wyfe eſpouſed: he ſente for hys bretherne &amp; for his coſyn Mawgys that were at Mountawban, the whiche made great Ioye, and made all Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban for to be hanged wyth ryche ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſery. And than they mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted their horſes all couered wyth ſendall and wente to Bordews, and met with Reynawde and hys wyfe by the way where as great Iuſtinge was made afore the ladyes. And after the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng was doone: they came all to Mountawban, and whan they were come there: the Ioye began for to be greate in the caſtell as god had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended there. For to ſay trouth .viii. dayes laſted the feaſt, &amp; many great gyftes were preſented and gyuen to the lady. And whan the feaſt had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured as longe as I tell you: The king Yon went againe to Bordews ryght glad of the maryage, that he had made of Reynawde and of hys ſyſter. For he thought wel that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſhould helpe hym agaynſt al men, and he ſayd trouth. For after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Mariage was ones made there was no baron in all Gaſcoygne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> durſte looke vp, and yet there were ſome that wolde not doo theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyre to the kynge, but Reynawde made them well come foorth for to doo the kynges commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to theyr lygeaunce wolde they or not. For reynawde was both loued and doubted through all the lande of Gaſcoygne. ¶ But now le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth heere the hiſtory to ſpeke of Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and of his bretherne and of Mawgys.

And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
<pb n="xliiii" facs="tcp:7017:49"/> Charlemayne ſawe it, he behelde it well a longe whyle and than ſayd. A good lorde yonder is a fayre caſtell ſtrong and wel ſet. I ſee well that the kyng Yon hath made it of late, for it ſemeth yet to be all newe, and it can be none otherwiſe ſyth that he hath buylded it in ſuche a ſtrong place, but that he thynketh to make warre to ſome body. And than he called to hym a knight of the lond and ſayd to hym tell me howe ye call that caſtel. Syr ſayd the knyght the name is Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban. He had great luſt to ſpeake, for yf he had keped his peace: there had been none other thyng of it, but he had ſuche woordes that afterward bare great harme to hym ſelfe, and to manye other. For he tolde Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that Reynawde and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the ſonnes of Aymon had doo make the caſtell, &amp; was called Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban. And how that the kyng Y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had geuen to Reynawde his ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his wife.</p>
            <p>WHan Charlemayne vnderſtode theſe wordes: he was ryght angry for it and wrothe. And wyſt not what he ſhould ſaye, and helde hymſelf a great whyle that he ſpake not, and whan he had muſed a lytle, he ſayde to his folke, fayre lordes I ſhall tell you a wonder. For I haue founde myne enemyes in this lond, that ben the foure ſonnes of Aymon. Now vp Ogyer and you duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, lyght on horſbacke incontinent, and ſeke ſo muche kyng Yon that ye fynde hym, and tell hym in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe that he yelde to me againe the foure ſonnes of Aymon that be mine enemyes them whiche he hath wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen and borne out agaynſt me. And that he fynde me knyghtes for to bryng them onlye in to my lond for I am delyvered ſyth that I haue founde them: for to hange them or fley them: quycke. And yf he wyll not doo ſo: defye you hym on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. And tell hym that wythin this thre or foure monethes I ſhalbe with in his land of Gaſcoygne wyth all my Hoſte, and I ſhall diſtroy and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe all his townes and caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and yf I maye take hym: I ſhall punyſſhe hym wythout any mercy. Syr ſayd Ogyer we ſhall doo youre commaundement, but we ſhall take with vs Sauces and hoſtes the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che been prue and ſage, and Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſaid that he was content and incontinent they went on theyr way. And wente aboute to vnderſtande where kyng Yon was. And ſo long they aſked after hym that they founde hym at Mountawban euen at the foote of the roche. For the king yon went agayne to Bourdews and Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde conueyed him. Whan Ogyer ſawe Reynawde and the kyng Yon: he knewe them well. And inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente he ſalued the kyng, and ſayde to him. Syr god geue you good lyfe and longe. And the kynge rendred to hym his ſalute, and after ſayde to him. Of whence be you? ſyr ſayde O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyer. We been of the ſweet Fraunce. And alſo we be ſente vnto you. And we are of Charlemaynes folke, now heare vs if it pleaſe you.

And within theſe iii. monethes he ſhall be in Gaſcoigne and ſhall take all your landes and ſhall be ſyege you with in the citie of Bordews. And yf he take you: he ſhal punyſhe you in your body. Now haue we ſayde our meſſage, and yf it pleaſe you ye ſhall gyue vs an anſwere.</p>
            <p>OGyer ſayde the kynge, it is well trouthe that I haue reteyned the foure ſonnes of Aymon, whyche bene worthye knyghtes, and ſo haue I reteyned theym becauſe they bene prue and valiaunt in armes, and alſo that they haue holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſocoured me at my great need. For I was diſheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vndoone for euer, if they had not bene. And for the greate good that they haue done to me: I haue gyuen my ſyſter Germayne to Reynawde for his wyfe. And therefore I ſhould be to cruell and eke well miſchaunt if I ſhould now take them into the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of their enemyes mortall ſith, that they haue doone to me ſo good ſeruyſe I haue leuer to be diſheryted and dye an euyll death than to yelde them or ſuffre that they haue anye harme nor ſhame to my power. For namely the kynge Charlemayne ſhould than hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de me for a foole &amp; wel nyce. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ogyer yf it pleaſe you ye ſhall tell the Emperoure from my behalfe that I ſhall for ſake fyrſt all my lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and my realme than I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer them in his handes. And thys is my anſwere.</p>
            <p>THan whan the king had ſayd thus: Reynawde ſpake after and ſayde. Ogier I meruayll greatly of the kynge Charlemaine that will not leaue vs in peace.

For yet am I redy for to doo his wyll in reaſon &amp; ryght. And I tell you well that yf he refuſe this by his pryde: I wyll well that he know that I and mi bretherne are not ſuche that ſhall be taken as lyghtly as he weeneth. And I promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe you that or euer he hath vs: I ſhall make hym more than .x. tymes angrie and wroth. For this that he dothe, he dothe it but of pryde.

            <p>ANd wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charlemaine had ſaid this: there was none of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons that anſwered to him any worde, for they were werye of the warre that they had made ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Reynawde. And Charlemaine ſawe that no bodye anwered to him no thing: he called to him the Duke Naimes and Ogier the Dane and the Erle Guydellon, and ſaide to them. Lordes what counſell doo you geue
<pb facs="tcp:7017:51"/> gyue to me in this matter. Syr ſayde the Duke Naymes, yf ye wyll beleue me I ſhall gyue you good counſeyl. Suffre youre hoſte to reſte thys fyue yeres, bycauſe that your folke is wery of the warre, ſo ſhall they reſte them ſelfe a lytell. And whan they ſhall be freſſhe: than ſhal ye mow make warre at youre wyll, for euery manne ſhall than come to it with good wyll. And whan themperoure vnderſtoode this counſeyll: he was ſore an angred for it that he wente almoſte oute of hys witte, and as he would haue ſayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſt the duke Naymes: there came a yonge gentylman of greate beautye, and brought in his company xxx. faire ſquiers well arayed, this yongelynge came to the palays and went vp, and whan he came afore the Emperour he made hys obeyſaunce to hym full cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſye, freend ſayde the kynge ye be ryght welcome, what winde brought you hither and what be you? ſyr ſayde the ſquier. I am called Rowlande of bretayne and I am the ſonne of youre ſiſter and of the duke of Myllon.</p>
            <p>THan whan Charlemayne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode Rowlande ſpeake thus: he was right glad of him and tooke him by the hand and kiſſed him many times, &amp; ſayd to him, ye be righte wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. I wil that ye be made a knyghte to morowe in the mornynge &amp; ye ſhall aſſaye your ſelfe vpon Reinawde the ſonne of Aymon.

He ſlewe my coſyn Berthelot wherof I am ryghte ſory, and therefore I ſhall auenge hys death yf I may by ony maner, or elles Reynawde ſhall ſlea me. And in the mornynge the kynge Charlemayne dowbed hys neuewe Rowlande to a knyghte with muche Ioye and with great honour, &amp; as the feaſt was a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge: there came a meſſanger that ſaid to the Emperoure.

            <p>ANd when the Emperoure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood theſe tydynges: he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his head toward the erth, and beganne to thinke a litell. And whan Rowlande ſaw his vncle that muſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ANd whan Rowlande ſawe that it was time to ſet vpon: he yſſued oute of his embuſſhmente with his folke, and went and ſmote vpon the ſaraſyns ſo harde that he caſted to the earthe a greate parte of theim. And to ſpeake ſhortly: the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle began ſo cruell &amp; ſo fell that it was pitie to ſee. For ye ſhould haue ſeene ſo many ſpeares broken, &amp; ſo many ſheldes in two, &amp; ſo many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſins lying dead on the grounde: ſo that with paine men might goe by for the deade men that laye ſo thicke one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thother, &amp; Rowlande ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his horſe with the ſpurres &amp; we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; ſmote a ſaraſin that was a kynge &amp; the chiefe of the ſaraſins hoſte with ſo great mighte that he ouerthrewe him to the erthe, but he ſlew hym not of that ſtroke, but taryed vpon hym and gaue to him ſuche a ſtroke with his ſwearde vpon his helme that he made him all aſtonyed. And whan Rowlande ſawe hym alſo euyl arai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he bowed hymſelfe &amp; tooke hym for his pryſoner, and dyd ſette hym againe vpon his hors &amp; brought him with hym. And whan the ſaraſyns ſawe their lorde taken and ſawe the wundres of armes that Rowland made and of the frenſhemenne: they put theimſelfe to flyghte full ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And whan Rowlande ſaw the

Lordes goe after theym for they flee al, and if they ſcape vs: it ſhalbe to vs a greate blame towarde myne vncle the kyng Charlemaine, and we ſhalbe holden for cowardes, wherfore I pray you lette not one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, for ye ſhall haue theym lyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſyth that I holde in my hande theyr kyng. Whan the frenſhemenne heard Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſpeke thus: they ſaid free knight be not dyſmaied of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, for we make no doubte that none of theym ſhall ſcape, but they ſhalbe taken or ſlayne. Lordes ſayde than the king ſaraſin that Rowland had taken that had to name Eſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fawde. They bene all mine, I praye you that ye kylle theym not, for they ben all ynough diſcomfited, ſith that ye haue taken me, but gyue theym truce, and haue me to kyng Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne yf it pleaſe you. And yf ye may doo ſo much that Charlemaine pardone me the great offence that I haue done to him: I ſhall boide fro hence forth all myne heritage of him &amp; yet all my lygnage ſhall be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunte vnto his will, and of this ye may beleue me. By my heade ſayde Rowlande ye ſpeake curteouſly, &amp; by my faith ſaide Naimes Eſcorfawde ſayth well, and we ſhall doo ſo, they gaue truce to the ſaraſins and tooke their waie againe to Charlemayne &amp; brought Eſcorfawde with theym and ſo long they rode that they came to Paris. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne knewe that his neuewe Rowlande was come againe to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, and that he had dyſcomfyted the ſaraſins and brought priſoner with him kyng Eſcorfawde: he was right glad of it, and anon he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſebacke, and came ayenſt his neuewe Rowlande. And whan Rowland ſaw him: he lighted down from hys horſe, and went and keſt hym ſelfe to the feet of kyng Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne his vncle. And anon he made him to riſe vp, and kyſſed him ſweetly: And than Rowlande ſaid to him. Sir here I deliuer vnto you the king Eſcorfawde, that we haue taken.

Than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the emperoure that Eſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faude ſhoulde be brought to priſon, and that he ſhoulde be wel kept and that he ſhoulde haue all his will of meate &amp; drinke. And after whan Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corfawde was put in priſon: the king Charlemayne dyd calle to him the Duke Naymes and ſayde to him what thinke you by my neuew Row<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande, what dyd he whan the batayl was aſſembled. Sir ſayde the duke Naymes, of Rowlande nedeth not to ſpeke, for neuer ſith that god was borne, of the vyrgin Marie: ſuche a knight was not ſeen. For he alone hath ouercome the ſaraſins by hys great prowes. And yf he had a horſe that might beare him whan he were armed: I ſwere by my fayth that ye ſhould neuer haue enmye, but that he ſhould bring him to your mercye by force of armes. So muche he

But tell me ſayde he to the duke Naymes: where might menne fynde ſuche a good horſe as ye ſpeake of? Sir ſayd the duke Naymes yf ye will beleue me: I ſhal geue you good counſeyll. Make to be cryed with a trompet vpon Mounte martyr that ye wyll ſee renne al the horſes of your hoſte, And he that ſhal renne beſt: ſhal win youre crowne of golde, and fyue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And whan ye ſhall haue ſeen him: by hym, and gyue hym to your neuewe Rowlande, and after gyue leue to all youre barons vnto the feaſt of ſaynt Iohn the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſt next comming. Duke Naymes (ſaid the Emperoure Charlemaine) ye gyue me good counſeyll, &amp; I ſhal doo thus as ye haue deuiſed. Than the kinge Charlemayne made to be cryed vpon Mounte martyr euyn thus as the duke Naymes had deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and did make the liſtes for the horſes to renne in. And whan thys was done: he made his crown to be ſette at the ende of the lyſtes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the fyue hundred marke of ſiluer and the hundred rolles of ſylke, and this hanging: a yeman went to hys countrey in Gaſcoine, and as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed thorough Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Reynawde and to Mawgys all the thyng that menne wolde doo at Paris. And how Rowlande was come to the courte. And how he had dyſcomfited Eſcorfawde the kyng ſaraſyn, and howe the king Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne wolde haue the beſt horſe of all his realme, for to gyue hym to Rowlande, and ſhewed the ſayd yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the price that the King had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For I will goe there vpon Bayarde to ſee how he ſhall proue himſelfe at this time. Syr ſayd Mawgis ye ſhall not doo ſo yet, but and if ye will goe there ſuffre that I here you companye, ſo ſhal you be more ſure, &amp; haue with vs knightes well armed.

I beleue that he hathe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me euill thought, ſir ſaide Mawgis it is my ſonne, and he can not ſpeake no frenſh. For he hath bene nouriſſhed in the greate Bretaine. Whan the
<pb facs="tcp:7017:54"/> duke Naymes vnderſtoode this: he ſayde to Reynawde tell me vaſſell knoweſt thou no tydynges of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde the ſonne of Aymon? and Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde anſwered to him in this wiſe.

            <p>THan whan the duke Naymes heard Reinawde ſpeake thꝰ euyl: he began to laugh. And after ſaide to him againe, a hundred deuyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les haue well taught thee to ſpeake ſo good frenche, vaſſell I wote not what thou ſayeſt thou arte more lyke a foole than a biſſhop. And ſo Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes let him in peace. And than Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and Mawgys tode ſo longe that they came to Parys tyme ynou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe for to doo theyr enterpryſe. And at the entre of the towne: they mette with an euill rybaude, vnto whome GOD geue yll aduenture. For he knew Reinawde. And as ſoone as he ſawe him: he beganne to cry with an high voice, heere commeth Reinawde the ſonne of Aymon. Whan the folke vnderſtoode the cry: they wente that way. And whan the yl rybawde ſaw com ſo many folke: he was yet more hardye than he was afore, and wente afore the other, and tooke Reinawde by the bridle of Baiarde. And whan Baiarde ſawe that: he lifted his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote and ſmote the ribaude vpon the breſt, that he braſt the herte in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, &amp; caſted him all dead to the erthe And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people ſaw the ſtroke: thei began all to laugh, and Bayard went forth, &amp; Maugis after that thei were not knowen: &amp; paſſed through the towne to the market. And whan thei were comen there afore the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: thei founde all the Innes full. Wherof Reynawde was maruailed.

For by him was almoſte Reinawde and Mawgys taken, and delyuerd to Charlemaine that his bretherne ſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de not haue holpen hym of no thynge. whan they were lyghted and lodged where it is ſayde, &amp; that their horſes were well dreſſed: Mawgys dyd doo make a bedde for Reynawde and toke a thred of ſylke, and ſered it well and came to Bayarde, and bounde hym the mowes of the feet there withall well ſtreyte. And the hoſte behelde well this, and after ſaid to him. Why haue you thus bounde this horſe? he ſhall not conne well goe. But tel me what knighte is he that oweth the horſe? For if he had of age more than he hath? I ſhould wene to knowe him For he is muche lyke Reynawde the ſonne of Aymon.

            <p>Now haue I telled you that, that ye haue aſked me. Certes anſwered the hoſte youre ſonne is a fayre felawe, but I beleue ye mocke me. ¶ Nowe ſhall ye heare a greate miſaduenture that happed to Reynawde and alſo vnto Mawgys. For thus as Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys ſpake with his hoſte: he named Reynawde. Ha ſyr ſayde the hoſte ye haue ſayde ynoughe, ye need not for to hyde it ony more. For it is Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde

And whan Mawgis ſawe this, he was ryghte ſory for it, and ſaide to Reynawde.</p>
            <p>What haue you doone? haue you loſte your wytte? but if God thinke vpon vs we bene loſt and ſhamed. I can not doo therto ſayd Reynawde. But how ſomeuer it gothe he hath his rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. And than Mawgis came forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the ſtable and ſadled Bayar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. And made Reinawde to mounte vpon him, and after himſelfe lyghted vpon Morell, and went out of the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And whan the wyfe and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the hoſte ſawe thys that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde had doone: they began to crye, But Reynawde and Mawgys were ſoone out of their waye, ſo that none wyſte where that they were become and wente and put them ſelfe amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the other in the preſe, and they were neuer knowen. But Baiarde wente haltinge, and wente to the gate of ſaynt Martyne, and there they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode all the nighte. And whan it was day: they wente with the other to the chyrche where the kinge hearde his maſſe. And whan the ſeruyſe was done: the kynge came oute of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, &amp; mounted vpon his horſe, &amp; all the other barons with him and came vpon the riuer of Sayne in to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, and Renawde and Mawgys wente with them, but Bayarde went ryghhte ſore haltynge. And whan the Kynge was come there: he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that his crowne ſhoulde be ſette at the ende of the lyſtes, and the fyue houndred marke of ſyluer, and alſo the houndred clothes of ſylke, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continente the Duke Naymes and Ogier did as the Kings had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. And whan all was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>railled: Thenne ſhoulde ye haue ſene knightes leape on horſebacke. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye man trowed to haue gotten the price, and the kinge commaunded to the duke Naymes and to Ogyer, vnto Guydellon of Burgoyne and to Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde of Normandy, that they ſhould take a hundred knyghtes well armed and that they ſhoulde keep well the feaſte, that no noyſe nor no ſtryfe were there made, and that none ſhould wronge the other, and they dyd his commaundemente. And thenne the knyghtes that ſhoulde renne: begane for to beholde Reynawde that was mounted vpon haltinge Bayarde, and ſo they beganne for to laughe and ſcorne with him. And ſayde in Iape the one vnto the other, this felawe ſhal winne the price. And the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of fine golde, and ſaide beware that his fote ſmite you not, and than
<pb facs="tcp:7017:55"/> the other ſayde he ſhall wynne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, and an other knight ſayd to Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, ye haue wel doone ſweet kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght for to haue brought youre horſe heere, and if god deſtineth him: ye ſhal wynne the pryſe this day. Reynawde vnderſtoode full well the greate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that men ſaid to him wherof his here ſwelled high, that if it had not be for doubt to haue loſt the pryce: be wolde haue begon the ſtrife, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he helde his peace, and made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noiſe nor worde againſt it.</p>
            <p>THan whan themperoure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode the great wordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the knyghtes ſayde to Reynawde: he was wrothe for it, and he ſaid ſo high that it was well heard of all. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde you vpon paine of my grace that ye ſaye no ſhame nor yll worde to no maner of knyght. For yf ye doo ye ſhall anger me ſore. But Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde cared not much of that it was ſaide to him. Whan the Duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Ogyer ſawe that it was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for to renne: they made to ſowne the trompettes. Then euerye man putted hym ſelfe for to renne, And whan Mawgis ſawe that euery man ran: he lighted on foote and vnbound the foote of Bayarde. But or euer he was vnbounde: the other were wel ferre, and whan Reynawde ſaw that it was tyme for to renne after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he ſpurred his horſe, &amp; ſaid to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde, we been ferre behynde ye my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght wel abide. For if ye be not ſoone afore: ye ſhall be blamed, whan Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde heard his maiſter ſpeake thus: he vnderſtoode him as well as thoughe he had been a man. Than he grylled his noſethrels and bare his head vp and made a long necke, and tooke his courſe ſo faſt that it ſemed the erthe ſhould haue ſonken vnder hym, and within a whyle he was paſſed all the other horſes a ferre waye ſo that men coulde not ſee him for duſt that he rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And whan thei that tooke heed to the courſes ſawe Baiarde ren thus: they were greatly abaſhed with all, &amp; ſayde the one to thother beholde that whyte horſe renneth faſt and lyght, and but late he halted ſore, he is the beſt of all thother that been heere.</p>
            <p>ANd whan themperour ſawe this: he called to him Richard of Normandye, and ſayde to hym, ſawe ye euer ſo many good horſes to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gither as heere ben now? but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whyte paſſeth them all, God how is he well like baiarde the horſe of Reynawde? yf he had the heares of Bayarde: I ſhould ſaye that it were he hym ſelfe, and he that ſytteth vpon him is alſo light and prue. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Thus wyte it that Reynawde hath doo ſo muche that Bayarde hath ouercome all the other horſes. And whan he was at the end of the lyſtes: he tooke the crowne and put it on his arme, and the ſyluer and the clothe he left alone, for he day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to take them. And whan he hadde taken the crowne: he returned agayne towarde the kyng Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine all faire and a ſoft pace, whan the kynge ſawe hym come towarde hym, he ſayde to hym all laughyng. Freend abyde a lytle I praye you, for yf ye wyll haue my crowne ye ſhall haue it, and I ſhall geue you for your horſe ſo greate hauoyre: that ye ſhall haue
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:7017:55"/> neuer be poore. By God ſayde Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde theſe wordes ſhall nought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle you, now haue I well begyled you, for I go doo marchaundiſe els where and I holde you for a chylde. I haue ſo often angred you &amp; of youre men I haue ſo many ſlayne. I am Reynawde that beareth away your crowne, ſeke els where for a nother horſe that ye ſhall giue to Rowland for to ouercome Baiard, for ye ſhal not haue bayarde nor alſo your cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne. And as ſoone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ſaid this he ſpurred bayarde wyth hys ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and went ſo faſt a way that it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the tempeſt had chaſed hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And whan the kynge Charlemayne vnderſtode thys y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Reynawde had ſayd to hym: he was wode angry for it that he wyſte not what he ſhould doo ſo that he myght not of a greate whyle ſpeake a worde. And whan he had recouered his ſpeche: he began to crye with a hye voyce, nowe after lordes after, for it is myne enemye Reynawde the ſonne of Aymon.</p>
            <p>And whan the knyghtes heard thus crye the kynge Charlemayne: they ſpurred theyr horſes with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpurres and went after Reynawde, but their goynge auayled theym nought. For Bayard was ferre from them with in a whyle ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wyſt not where he was become, and Reynawde cam to Sayne and paſſed ouer it al at his eaſe with ſwymynge, for Bayarde was well wonte therto, and alſo he had paſſed it afore with more great haſte. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Reynawde was thus paſſed the ryuer of Sayne: he lyghted from Bayarde at the banke of it. Thus hanging: the king Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne and his knightes that folo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed after hym, came to the ryuers ſyde, and began to call Reynawde &amp; ſayd to hym. Ha true man, ſoone yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de me my crowne agayne and I ſhal gyue thee .x. tymes as muche as it is worthe, and I ſhall gyue thee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce two yeres, ſo that thy ſelfe and thy brethern ſhall mow go in ardey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to ſee your mother the which deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſore to ſee you, and there is no knyght in my lande that ſhal ſay co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, by god ſayd Reynawde as for theſe wordes auayle you nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, for ye ſhall neuer haue agayne your crowne. I ſhall ſell it and ſhall pay my knyghtes withall, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boncle that thus ſhyneth ſhal be ſet hye vpon my pauylyon to the ende that they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall go to ſaynt Iames in Galyee may ſee it the better, and ye ſhall be blamed of your knyghtes that ye haue loſte your crowne by the horſe Bayarde, whan Charlemayn hearde hym ſpeake thus: he wyſt not what he ſhould ſay for angre, &amp; kept himſelf ſtyl like as he had ben dead. And whan Reynawde had ſayde ſo: he mounted agayne vpon Bayarde and put hymſelf to the way, but not the ryght way: but rode throughe a lytle pathe whyche he had paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tyme.</p>
            <p>NOw ſhal I tell you of Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys how he dyd for to come out of Parys y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was mounted vpon his horſe morell. Whan he wyſt that Reynawde was paſſed Sayne he iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of Parys and paſſed the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ouer the brydge as ſoone as he might. And whan he was without:
<pb facs="tcp:7017:56"/> he began to looke after Reynawde &amp; as he rode he looked a trauerſe and ſawe Reynawde, ſo called he after hym as hie as he could, coſyn thinke to ryde faſt, for to tary heere no good ſhall come to vs, coſyn ſayde Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ye ſaye well and we ſhall doo ſo. And ſo they tooke theyr waye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde Myllon. And whan Alarde ſaw his brother come and Mawgis: he ſayd to his folke. Lordes we may well come out of our buſſhemente, for I ſe come my brother Reynawde &amp; Mawgys. Alas ſayd Richarde I ſee them come wyth greate haſte. I fere me muche that men chaſe them. Now light we al on horſe backe and yf they haue myſtre of vs: let vs go helpe and ſuccour them. And they anſwered all we ben all redy, &amp; whan they came out of theyr buſſhement: there came Reynawde and Mawgis that ſayd to them lordes thynke to make haſte. For the longe taryenge might doo to vs harme bicauſe that I brynge wyth me the crowne of Charlemayne, the whiche Bayarde hath made me wynne by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe. And whan Alarde vnderſtode his brother ſpeake thus: he was ſo greatly in Ioye that he wyſte not what he ſhould ſay but colled &amp; kyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his brother Reynawde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greate Ioye. And than incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they put themſelfe to the waye and ſo longe they rode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came to Orleaunce and paſſed the ryuer of Loyre wyth all dylygence, and after they made ſo muche by theyr Iourneys: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came to Mountawban whole and glad, thanked be god.</p>
            <p>THan whan they were at mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban: the lady came them agaynſt &amp; receyued them right glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and made them ryght great there and all the folke of the Caſtell were ryght glad of the comynge of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and of hys bretherne, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him how he had doone in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, lordes ſayd Reynawde wel god gramercy. I was knowen of myne hoſte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych wolde haue betrayed and accuſed me, but I ſolde it to him ful deere, I cloue his head to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teeth and went out of hys houſe by night and put vs in the preſe of the other, but ye wyſt neuer folke ſo wel ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as we were, for the folke of char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne mocked me and Bayarde, wherof the king was angry, &amp; thus they left me in peace. And whan the trompettes began to blowe for to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe: they that ſhould renne departed incontinent, and I bode be hinde well the ſhotte of a bowe, and I tell you well for certayne, there were well twenty thouſande horſes. And whan I ſaw me behynde: I ſaid to Bayarde that it ſhould be great ſhame to hym yf he abode behynde, but god gramercy and Bayarde I ouer ranne them al.

Whan the kinge ſaw that all his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons were come: he made them al to come before hym &amp; ſayd to them, lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ye all knowe right well (at the leſt the moſte party of you) howe I haue ouercome &amp; ſubdued .xl. kinges in my dayes, the whyche are all to me obeyſſaunt, excepte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge Yon of Gaſcoyn that hath withdrawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his lande my enemies mortall, that ben the foure ſonnes of Aymon, ye know well the great diſhonour thei haue doone to me, wherof I me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne vnto you &amp; praye you &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde you that ye come wyth me into Gaſcoyn for to helpe me that I be auenged of the greate harme and ſhame that theſe foure ſonnes of Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doo to me, for by your othe ye ben all beholden thervnto.</p>
            <p>THan ſayd the erle of Nantuel, Syr wee ſhall not goe there at this tyme. Ye know well that that wee ben come out of Spayne but late, wherof we ben yet all we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye. And alſo in this felawſhyp ben many princes and barons that haue not ben yet in theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey nor ſeen theyr wiues and children, and ye wil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, that we go into Gaſcoyn vpon the kyng Yon, &amp; vpon the foure ſonnes of Aymon: And I tell you that the two wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I receyued in Spai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne be not yet whole, and therfore we may not goe into Gaſcoyn at thys tyme. But yf it pleaſe you ye ſhall doo as a good kynge and a ſage, and ſhall ſhewe that ye loue your folke, For ye ought to kepe them as youre ſelfe. Wythdrawe your hoſte vnto whytſonday next coming and gyue leaue to all your barons to goe to their places for to reſt them a while, And whan the tyme ſhall be come &amp; that your pleaſure is to call theym: they ſhall than be all freſſhe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
<pb facs="tcp:7017:57"/> to fulfil your commaundement wyth all diligence. Whan the kynge vnderſtode theſe wordes: he was wro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the and ſware by ſaynte Denys of Fraunce, ſaying in thys maner, if I ſhould be dyſſheryted I ſhall goe now into Gaſcoyn, and I ſhall take wyth me all the younge folke of my hoſte: the whiche I ſhall put in good ſtraye honeſtly, and I ſhall gyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all that they ſhall need, thoughe ye ſhould abyde behynde as weke men and feynte. Syr ſayd the duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ye ſay well, for thys yonge men ſhalbe ryght glad for to aſſaye them ſelfe. Therfore wyll I doo it ſayde kyng Charlemayne and ſo ſhall the kyng Yon be deſtroyed, and whan I ſhall haue Reynawde and hys bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, and Mawgys the theete take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I ſhall departe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lande of Gaſcoyne to theſe yonge knightes for theyr he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytage. This hangyng that the king Charlemayne ſayd theſe wordes: a ſpye that longed to Reynawde was in thys companye that vnderſtode all that ſayde is. And whan the ſpye had hearde all together well: he put hymſelf to the way, and dyd ſo much by his Iourneys, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came to mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban, where he founde Reynawde his brethern, and Mawgys. And in contynent that Reynawde ſaw him he demaunded of hys what tydyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges bryng you fro Parys and from the courte of kynge Charlemayne?</p>
            <p>My Lorde ſayd the ſpye, wyt it that kyng Charlemayne is greatly wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the with kynge yon and agaynſt you and againſt your brethern, &amp; againſt Mawgys. He hath ſente for all his ſubiectes in his Empyre, but none wolde haue comen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him into Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>coygne. And then he ſware Saynte Denys y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould come into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To the which he ſhall gyue all Gaſcoygne, And ſayth that he ſhall beſyege Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban, and ſhall doo to be caſt downe the great towre, and ſhall ſet al Gaſcoygne in a tyre and flame. Than ſayd Reynawde to his folke, be not diſcouraged of nothing For I ſhall ſee how Rowlande and Oliuer ſhall beare themſelf agaynſt me and mi brethern. And than went Reynawde into the halle. And found his brethern and Mawgys with his knyghtes, and ſayd to them. Lordes I brynge you tidynges. Now wyt that the kyng Charlemayne cometh to beſyge vs, and bryngeth with him all the puyſſaunce of Fraunce.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs thynke to receyue him well, for he ſhall haue more to doo than he weneth, brother ſayd Alarde haue no doubte, for they ſhalbe well receyued, for as longe that we ſhall lyue and ſhal ſee you ryde vpon bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde: we ſhall not fayle you, nor wee ſhal not be a ferde to be taken nor ill handled. For no man aliue is worth you, nother of goodnes nor of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.</p>
            <p>THys hangyng: Charlemayn was aduyſed and thoughte vpon the counſell that the Duke of Nantuel had gyuen to him. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he called his folke &amp; ſayd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Lordes I gyue you leue, and let you wyt that at Eaſter I ſhall holde my counſell generall, and it pleaſe you.
<pb facs="tcp:7017:58"/> Now keep that ye faile not to come than well apparelled and redy, for I wolde not leaue for nothynge, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhould goe ſee the kyng Yon. And yf he yelde me not the foure ſonnes of Aymon: I ſhall doo to hym with out doubt ſo much ſhame that I ſhal make his berde to be cut of harde by the chynne. And alſo I ſhal take the crowne of Gaſcoygne from his hed and I ſhall make hym come a foote after me begginge his bread. And whan he had ſayde theſe wordes: The barons tooke leaue of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and wente into theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, but at theyr departing: Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine ſayd to them.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre well your ſelfe that ye come at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> terme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue ſet. For I ſwere vnto you that thoſe that ſhall not come, &amp; yf I euercome agayne from Gaſcoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne: they ſhall repente it full ſore.

            <p>WHan it was time for to come a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayne to the courte at the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that the kyng Charlemayne had ſet: euery man made hym ſelfe redy as well as he coulde for to come to the courte as they were expreſſelye charged they ſhould doo, fyrſt came there Rycharde of Normandye and brought wyth hym manye a noble knyght, and preſented hym ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the kynge Charlemayne euyn at ſaynt Denys. After came Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Bretayne, and brought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him of hys barons a fayre company and preſented hymſelfe to the kynge at ſaynt Denys. After came Dyſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Spayne which brought with him well .x. thouſand knightes wel armed, and well garnyſſhed of vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles. For in all the hoſte of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne was none ſo well arayed as they were of all thynges. And preſented hym ſelf in this maner at ſaynt Denys vnto the kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne. Than came Godfray the Ecle of Auynyon and brought with him all his power and a fayre co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and foyſon of vytayle. And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him and his folke to the king Charlemayne. And after came Pon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thus out of Almayne, &amp; brought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym afayre companye of men of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. For he had wyth him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and of Armony, and wel three thouſand archers, the whych for no doubt of death wolde neuer flee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> batayle. And preſented hym ſelfe and hys felawſhip to the kyng char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne, the whiche he receyued ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght honourably. Than after came the good biſſhop Turpin, and brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght wyth hym a fayre company and well enewred to the warre, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented hymſelf to the kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, that was ryght glad of hys comyng, for the byſſhop was a good true man. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Charlemaine truſted muche to hym for his great fydelitie, and alſo for the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes that was in hym.</p>
            <p>AL the great Lordes that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de theyr landes of the kyng
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:7017:58"/> Charlemayne came to Parys &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelfe and theyr men to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge Charlemayne that receyued them with great Ioye and was glad to ſee aboute hym ſo fayre a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of good men of warre, but I tel you that whan the hoſte was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Parys: there was ſo great a derth that it was great pitie, for the raſour of where was ſolde for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhelynges and twenty pence and yf the kynge had taried there any le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. there ſhould haue ben ſo greate a derth that all the ſmall people had ben all dead for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre. But the king Charlemayne began for to make hys muſtres, for to know how much people that he had. And whan the the muſtres were made: they found that they were well .xxx. thouſande knyghtes that had theyr fyrſt berdes beſyoe the olde knyghtes that were well an hundred thouſand. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that this was doone: the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Charlemayne called Rowland his neuew afore him and ſayde to hym. Fayre neuew I recomende to you myne hoſte, and I pray you that ye wyll conduyte it by good maner. Syr ſayd Rouland I ſhal doo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my deuoyre after my power. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to be take to hym the oryflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be, and departed out of Parys, and they did ſo muche by ſmal Iourneis that they came to Bloye, and than Charlemayne made to be cryed that all the vytaylers of the land ſhould goe wyth vitayle after the hoſte. And yf that they brought that were worth a peny: they ſhould haue two for it. And whan that thys greate armye was come to Bloy they paſſed ouer Gyronde and wente afore the great caſtell of Mountawban. And they lodged themſelf there rounde about the place. And then the Frenche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began to ſay the one to the other, by myne othe there is a fayre caſtel and a ſtornge and but yf wee get ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte, heere ſhall we wynne but a lytle.</p>
            <p>ANd whan the batayles were ordeyned rounde about mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tawban: Rowland began for to ſay to the kynge Charlemayne. Syr me ſemeth that wee ſhould nowe gyue a ſawte to Mountawban. And the Kynge anſwered, I wyll not that my folke haue any dommage, but fyrſte I wyll knowe yf the caſtel wil holde or yelde vp. For yf he wyl be gyuen vp: I wolde not that anye batayle ſhould be doone to it. And than inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinent he ſent a knyght mounted v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a mewle all vnarmed, the why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che came vnto the gate of the caſtel, and whan they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kept the gate ſawe that it was a meſſanger: they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hym the gate, and the Knight entred into the caſtel. And as he was come in, he found the ſtewarde with an hundred men that wente aboute viſitynge the watches and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Incotinente the knyght ſalued hym, and the ſtewarde rendred hym agayne hys ſalute and ſayd to him. What be ye Gentylman, and what ſeke you heere wythin? I pray you tell me what folke are yonder wythout ſo fayre a company. Syr ſayde the knyght they ben the folke of the Emperour Charlemaine that is come for to beſyege the Caſtell of
<pb facs="tcp:7017:59"/> Mountawban, and I am one of his knyghtes that am come heere for to ſpeake with Reynawde from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Charlemayne. Than the ſtewarde tooke the knyght by the hande and led him before Reynawde the ſonne of Aymon. And whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knyght ſaw Reynawde: he made reuerence to him and after ſayd to hym, Reynawde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour Charlemayne ſendeth to you worde by me, that yf you wyll yelde your ſelfe to hys mercy, &amp; giue to hym your brother Richarde to doo his wyll of hym: he ſhall haue mercy of you.

And tell the kynge that he ſhall doo well and wyſely to take ſuch fyue knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as we ben. And yf Charlemayn refuſeth this: I haue myne hope ſo faſt to our Lorde god that wee ſhall not ſet moche by the kynge, nor of his great hoſte. The meſſanger vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode well the anſwere that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde had doone to hym: and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynent he retourned to Charlemain and ſhewed to hym all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Reynawde had ſayd worde by worde. Whan the Emperour vnderſtode the wordes of Reynawde: he began for to thynke a good whyle, for he knew that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſayde but well, And than he ſent for the Duke Naymes and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier the Dane and ſayd vnto them. Lordes, Reynawde ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth me worde that he ſhall doe nothynge after my wyll. And for this cauſe I wyl that the caſtell be aſſayled forthwith. Sir ſayd the duke Naymes me ſemeth as I haue vnderſtande y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Reynawde offreth to you fayre, and yf ye wyll belyue me: ye ſhall take hym to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy wyth hys brethern. For ye knowe well that they be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folke that may doo to you good ſeruyce. And yf Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde be once in peace with you: ye ſhall be the better beloued and more dred therfore. But ſith that your wil cannot accorde to the ſame: we maye not doo therto. To aſſayle the caſtel I counſel it not. For ye ſee that the Caſtell is fayre and ryght ſtronge, and Reynawde hath whym a good company of good men, and he and his brethern, &amp; Mawgys ben ſuche knyghtes as ye knowe, yf ye doo aſſayle the caſtel: they ſhall yſſue out at the fauce poſternes, and ſhall doo to you ſo great a dommage of your folke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſhall be wrothe for it, but and yf ye wyll beleue my counſell: ye ſhall beſyege the Caſtell ſo nyghe that no man ſhal not come out nor cutre in but he ſhalbe take, and thus ye ſhall mow haue the Caſtell by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſhynge. For by no ſawte ye ſhall
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:7017:59"/> not haue it.</p>
            <p>CHarlemayne vnderſtode well theſe wordes and knew well that the duke Naymes ſpake wel &amp; wyſely and ſayd to hym. I wil that it be doone thus as ye haue deuyſed it. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made crye through his hoſte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man ſhould lodge hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf euyn nighe by the Caſtell, and he himſelfe commaunded that his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyllion ſhould be pight as nighe the gate as coulde be doone. After thys was cryed ye ſhould haue ſeen wyth in a litle whyle moe than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pauillions rounde aboute the Caſtell of Mountawban. Whan the hoſte was al lodged: Rowlande de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the hoſte well with two thouſand knightes wel armed &amp; wel horſed and all yonge men of pryme berde, whiche were very frenſhe born of the douce fraunce, and went at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide of Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban, in a place whiche is called Balancon where was a riuer great and deape, in the whych was fiſſhe ynough, and there he dyd pytche his pauillion. And ſo full he was of great pryde: that he bad ſet the dragon aboue vpon hys pauillion, and did doo make the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis of his felawes rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de about him And they were in ſuche a grounde where as they myght ſee from thens the woodes and the Ryuers and all the countrey, and Mountaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban that was vpon the great roche well cloſed, &amp; behelde the two great ryuers, that is to wit Gyround and Dordone, that enuyronned Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban.</p>
            <p>ROwlande ſawe the place ſo ſtronge that he meruaylled greatly, &amp; ſayd to hys folke.

For I promyſe you that Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban ſhal neuer be taken of vs, ye ſay not well ſayd Olyuer. For we tooke well by force Lezonne, &amp; alſo we ouerthrew downe the great towre and the doun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geon of Sernoble, wherof I ſaye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhall well haue Mountawban, And yf Reynawde and his bretherne come not and yelde them ſelfe: they ſhalbe in daunger of death. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe you ſayde Rowlande that they ſhall doo nothynge of that ye ſaye. For I promyſe you that the gentyll Reynawde ſhall make vs ſo ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferde that the moſte hardy wolde be at Parys. Reynawde is prue and coragious, and his brethern in lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe, and alſo they haue within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell many noble and worthy knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Wherfore I ſay and I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion, that as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge as they haue vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle they ſhall neuer be taken. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pauillion of Rowlande was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and pight vp: Rowlande behelde the riuer and ſaw that it was full of byrdes, than he ſayd to the Byſſhop Turpyn and to the other Barons, See howe wee are lodged in a good place. Let vs goe in theſe Ryuers to let flee our Fawcons. Syr ſayde the Biſſhoppe Turpin, goe in the name of God. Then lyghted Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande on horſebacke and tooke with
<pb facs="tcp:7017:60"/> hym wel .xxx. knightes, and no mo. And they tooke their hawkes, &amp; rode the moſte parte of them vpon mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les all vnarmed ſaue theyr ſwerdes and came and ſported them alonge the ryuer ſyde, &amp; tooke many byrdes vpon the water, in ſo great quantitie that they laded a horſe wythall, the byſſhop Turpyn and Ogyer, wente not there but abode behynde for to keep the hoſte, and they were before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tentes where they made two aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent knightes to recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te and tel how the great Troy was taken and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, this hangyng: was a ſpye in the hoſte of king Charlemaine, that longed vnto renawde, the whyche he had ſent there for to know what they wrought, and howe they dyd &amp; all the fayte of Rowlande, and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent the ſpye departed out of the hoſte and wente to Reynawde, and ſhewed to hym how Rowlande and Olyuer were gone to ſportynge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr Hawkes vpon the ryuer, and wyth them thyrtye of the beſt of the hoſte.</p>
            <p>WHan the ſpye had recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe tidynges to Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde: he was of it ryght glad. Than he called his brethern &amp; Mawgys his coſyn, &amp; tolde them how Roulande and Olyuer and .xxx of the beſte barons of Charlemayne were gone to hawking vpon the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in the plaine of Balanco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What ought we to doo ſayd Reynawde? Coſyn ſayd Mawgys we may well kill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we wyll, for they ben well proude &amp; folyſhe, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre ye not wel that a meſſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger tolde you a moneth a goe that Charlemayne had left all olde knightes of his Realme, &amp; had taken of the yonge, &amp; that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted all Gaſcoyne to the yonge ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chelers of Fraunce? And by thys bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban Rowland &amp; Olyuer ben moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into ſo great pryde that they trow in al the worlde is no man that dare aſſaile them nor looke vpon them an grely. But and yf ye wyl beleue me: I ſhall tell you ſuche a thynge, that ſhal make them wrothe &amp; ſory. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reinawde made ſowne his horne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer herde ſowned but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was need, for whan men hearde it: euery man ran to his armes for to arme hym. And incontynent Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and his bretherne, and Maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gys made themſelfe to be armed.</p>
            <p>And whan they were al armed and well apparelled: Reynawde lyghted vpon Bayarde his good horſe, and ſpurred hym wyth hys ſpurres, ſo that he made hym to lepe wel thyrty foote of length. Ha good horſe ſayd Reynawde: how ye make your ſelfe to be beloued. And how wel I miſtre you this dai. Let vs go aſſayle theſe vnhappy folke of the kyng Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne of Fraunce, and make we by ſuche a maner that we need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne twyſe, and therof I praye you all.</p>
            <p>ANd whan Reynawde ſawe that his folke was wel appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, he wente out with his men at a falſe poſterne, that they of the hoſte coulde not ſee them. And they were wel in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany about foure thouſand well horſed and well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, And a foſter conduyted them
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:7017:60"/> throughe the thyckeſt of the foreſt, &amp; Reynawde ſayd to the foſter, brynge me thou into the hoſte of Rowland without fayle, the Foſter anſwered to hym that he wolde doo it gladly. Than brought he them ſtreyght to Balancon. And whan Reynawde ſawe the pauylions: he ſhewed them to his folke, to whome he ſayde, be holde what fayre gayne wee haue founde heere yf wee dare ſet vpon them. Syr ſayd his men, let vs goe to it hardelye, for we durſte well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle the deuyl, whan ye be with vs. ¶ Nowe ſhall I tell you of the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Turpin that was a bid to keep the hoſte, wherof he had great feare bycauſe he wyſt well agaynſt whom he had a doo, and had a great ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion and heaued vp hys head, &amp; ſaw the Rauens &amp; the Dawes flee about vpon the fortreſſe. And from thens they tooke theyr flyght ouer Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des pauilion. And made great noiſe And ſo was he aferde, for he wende that it had be ſome euyll token, and he behelde towarde the woodes that were great, and ſaw anon hys ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, wherof he was ſore afrayde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> almoſte he was beſyde hymſelfe.</p>
            <p>Than he called Ogyer the Dane and ſayd to hym, free knyght for goddes loue goe arme your ſelfe, and let our folke be armed, for heere comen our enemyes. Now ben well Rowlande and Olyuer gone for nought that ar gone to the chaſe and haue left theyr hoſte thus in great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. I beleue that thei ſhal not fayle but they ſhal repente it ſore. Whan Ogyer hearde Turpyn ſpeake in thys maner: he was very ſore an angred, ſo went he in his pauylion and made hym to be armed incontynent for to moue the hoſte. And whan that the Frenche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hearde the trumpettes blowe: they put themſelf in ordenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Thys hanging: Ogyer was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and mounted vpon hys horſe Brayforde, and founde that a great parte of them was armed and al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. Than Ogier ſaid to them Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thynke to defende you well, for we ben aſſayled.</p>
            <p>REynawde was abaſhed whan he ſawe the hoſte that moued ſo: and ſayde vnto hys folke, Lordes we ben dyſcouered, but yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe let vs go to it and aſſayle them they anſwered that they were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for to doo ſo. And whan that Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde vnderſtode theſe wordes: he ſayde vnto Mawgys. Fayre Coſyn take a thouſande knyghtes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide heere within this wood. And if yee ſee that we need of more helpe: come than and ſuccoure vs. Gladly ſayde Mawgys your commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente ſhalbe do one. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Reynawde had ſayde ſo: he ſpurred Bayarde with his ſpurres, &amp; wente into the hoſte, &amp; paſſed the playne of Balancon, &amp; the fyrſt that he recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it was Emery the erle of Nicol, and ſmote hym ſo that he ſhoued his ſpeare thoroughe the bodye of him and fell dead to the erth. Then ſayd Reynawde ye ſhal abye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bargayne. falſe Glotton, ye dyd a greate folye whan ye came euer into Gaſcoygne And whan that he had ſayde thus: he ſet hys hande to his ſwerde. And began for to make ſo great occyſyon
<pb facs="tcp:7017:61"/> of knightes that none can tel it. And whan Reynawde ſaw his enemies ſo ſtrongelye abaſſhed: He began for to ſay, where is Rowlande and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer that ſo ſore hath thretened me and my folke, and ſaying that we be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> traytours? But and they ſaye ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me: I ſhould ſhew to them that they ſay not well nor trouth. Whan the biſſhop Turpyn vnderſtode this that Reynawde ſayde: He ſayde to Reynawde, ye nother ſaye well nor trouth, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpurred his horſe with the ſpurres, and went agaynſt Reynawde, and gaue eche other ſo great ſtrokes through theyr ſheeldes that they brake bothe theyr ſperes al in peces. But neyther of theym fell downe. And whan Reynawde had broken his ſpere: he ſet his hande to his ſwerd and gaue ſo great a ſtroke with it to the Biſſhop Turpyn vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his helme that he made bothe the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the horſe to rele ſore. And whan Reynawde ſaw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſſhop in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plight he ſayd to him, father be ye the ſame Turpyn that prayſeth your ſelfe ſo ſore? By my faith me ſemeth it were better for you to be in ſome churche to ſynge ſome maſſe then for to be heere, wening to greue me.</p>
            <p>THan whan the byſſhop Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyn vnderſtode the reproche that Reynawde made to hym: he tro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed well to haue gone oute of hys mynde for it. And ſet handes to hys ſwerde, &amp; went vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde. And then was the hoſte moued of one partye and of the other. Shortly to ſpeke: there were ſo many ſperes bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken, ſo many a knyght ouerthrowen and ſo mani horſes dead: that it was great pitie for to ſee. There was O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyer the Dane that had his ſheeld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hys breſt, and his ſwerde in his hand and ſat vpon Brayforde the whych ſmote Rycharde the brother of Reynawde ſo great a ſtroke: that his horſe fell downe to therth. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rycharde ſawe hym ſelfe a ground: he roſe vp agayne quickely as a kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght prue and valyaunt. And tooke his ſwerde in his hande, and Ogier paſſed beyonde for to folow his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and began to crye the baner ſaynt Denis. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde ſaw his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rycharde caſt on grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: he was wrothe for it. So ſpurred he hys horſe Bayarde, and went agaynſte Ogyer the dane, &amp; Ogier againſt hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp; gaue eche other great ſtrokes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr ſheeldes.

            <p>WHan Reynawde ſaw Ogier at the erth: he tooke Bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde by the brydle, and ſayde to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier, ye haue doone euyll for to haue caſte downe my brother afore me, ye knowe that ye be of my lignage and my coſyn nyghe, ye ſhould helpe and defende vs agaynſt all men.

<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:7017:61"/> promiſe you that yf I fayle of this, that ye ſaye: god punyſſhe me for it, Reynawde yeelded him agayne hys horſe, and helde the ſtyrop to Ogyer whan he lyghted agayne vpon hys horſe brayforde. And wyt it that Ogyer ſich dyd muche for Reynawd and yeelded hym again vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the roche mountbron, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of he was rebuked of Charlemaine ſhamefully.

Whan Mawgis ſaw that all the battaylles were thus medled togither: he cam out of the wood, and came to Balancon and put himſelfe &amp; his folke among the greateſt prece and began to cleaue and hew ſo hard heades legges and armes, that none durſte abyde longe afore him. And than the frenſhmen were ſo ſore and werye that they mighte no more and were all dyſcomfited at the paſſage of the ryuer, than they dyd put theym ſelfe to flight, and the gaſcoines cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them all beating a longe mile, &amp; after returned to the hoſte, and tooke al the hauoyr that they founde there, and Mawgis came to the pauillion of Rowland and tooke the dragon of golde that was ſet vpon the ſaid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillion, and they paſſed through Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancon, and ſo returned to Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban with greate ioye.

It is not longe a goe that he dyſcomfited Marcyl the puyſaunt Saraſin and chaſed him well foure mile, and ſmot of his heade and preſented it to you, and ye haue promyſed and ſworne to him that ye ſhal defend and keep him him ayenſt all menne. Mine vncle if ye thynke to faylle him and wil not holde that ye haue promiſed to him: let him and his bretherne goe out of your londe in to ſome other countrie to ſeeke theyr aduenture. And hapely they ſhall ſerue ſome lorde that ſhal doo to them more good then ye wyll doo, and alſo I praye you my deare lord and vncle as much as I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that ye wil doo nothing that turneth you to blame, nor to dyſhonour, nor that can be caſte by maner of reproche to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your freendes. Than ſpake the olde earle of Anſom and ſaid. Sir ye wil that we giue you counſeill, yf ye wil doo that we ſhal counſeil you: ye ſhal doo wel for your ſelfe. Now ſay on hardely ſaid the king that ſemeth you beſt to be doo, for I wyll doo as ye ſhall counſeyll me. Syr ſayde the earle ye haue wel heard ſaye, and ſo it was trouth, that Benes ſlew the earle Lohier, wherfore Charlemaine ſente for him and made hys head to be ſmyten of at Parys, and at that

And afterwarde whan they were great: the kyng wold amende it to them. For the thynge toucheth them, but they had the hert ſo fell that they wolde take none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendes, and laſted theyr hate longe, wherof euer ſyth hathe come greate harmes and euylles. For Reynawde ſlewe Berthelot the neuewe of the king with a cheſſe borde, ſir I know not why I ſhoulde hyde anye thynge fro your knowledge, ye knowe well that Charlemaine is ſo myghtye a kyng that he neuer vndertooke wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doo geue you counſeyll that ye yeelde Reinawde and hys brethern and Mawgis to the kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and thus ſhall ye be delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a greate thoughte, and of a greate daunger. And after thys: ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the erle of Mobandes and ſayde, ſyr yf ye wil doo this that the erle of Anſom counſeilleth you: yee and we ſhall be traytours. For Reynawd is your man, and ſo muche ye haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him that ye haue giuen hym your ſiſter to his wife. And whan he came in theſe marches, he came not lyke a knaue: but he came to you as a noble knighte prue and worthye. For he brought in his felawſhip foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande men well armed and well hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſaid to you afore vs all ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he tooke of his ſpurres, that he had warre with the kinge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.

And for you he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted mani batailles, &amp; did ſo much that he delyuered you from the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of your enemyes. And therfore ſyr I tell you that ye be not worthye to calle your ſelf, ne to bere the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vpon youre heade: if for feare of death ye betray ſuch knightes as are the foure ſonnes of Aymon. For ye haue not yet loſte nother Caſtell nor town, &amp; if ye doo it otherwiſe: ye ſhal be taken and holden for a traytoure. After ſpake Anthony the olde earle &amp; ſayde to the kinge. Syr beleue not this counſeyll, for ſuche counſeyll he gyueth you now wherof ye ſhall be betrayed at the laſt. For I know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then tent of Reinawde than anye man that is heere, ye muſt vnderſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Wherfore the kynge Charlemaine chaſed hym out of the realme of Fraunce. Nowe it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſo that he is in Gaſcoygne, and ye haue gyuen to hym great landes, and becauſe he hathe youre ſyſter to wife: he is become ſo proude that none maye dure afore hym. And he ſetteth not a peny nother by you nor by your courte. Wherfore I ſwere to you by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head that I beare, if he may by any wiſe he ſhal take the life from you for to haue all the realme to him ſelfe. Wherfore I aduyſe to you by rightwiſe counſell: that ye yeeld him and his bretherne to Charlemayne. And ye ſhall doo as a wiſe king, and ſo ſhall you peaſe the great wrath of the kyng Charlemayne of Fraunce. After ſpake the duke Guymarde of

Wherof I tell you that no kinge is not worthye to beare any crowne nor to haue honour that wil do treaſon for thretening of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lorde.

But I wot wel that my ſoule ſhall neuer haue therof no pardon. And ſhall be therfore taken all my life as a Iudas, and than they left the counſeyll, and went oute of the chambre. And whan the kynge was come out of the chambre: he ſet him downe vpon a benche, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to thinke ſore. And as he was in this thought: he began for to weep ſore for greate pitie that he had. And whan he hadde thoughte and wepte ynoughe: he called his ſecretary, and ſaide to him.

It is that I ſende him ſalutacion with good loue. And yf he wyll leaue me my londe in peace: I promyſe hym that afore ten dayes been paſſed. I ſhall deliuer vnto him the foure ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aymon and he ſhal find them in the playne of Valcolours, clothed with ſcarlet, futred with ermynes, and rydynge vpon mules, betynge in their handes floures, and Roſes for a token, for becauſe that menne ſhall better knowe them. And I ſhal make theym for to be accompanyed of eyghte earles of my realme, and if they ſcape from him: that he blame me not for it. Than ſayde the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſyr your commaundement ſhall be doone, the whiche tooke anon pen and ynke and wrote the letters word for worde as the king had deuiſed to hym. And when they were wryten and ſealed: the kynge called hys ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde and ſayde to hym. Now make you ready on horſebacke, and goe to the ſyege of Mountawban, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comende me vnto the kinge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and gyue hym theſe letters. And tell him yf he wyl quite my lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: I ſhall doo this that is of reaſon, and none otherwyſe.

            <p>WHan Charlemayne vnderſtood theſe tydynges: he was ryghte gladde, he tooke the lettre of the meſſanger, and called Rowlande to him &amp; Olyuer, the byſhop Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyn, the duke Naymes. Ogier the

And he found therin that whiche he moſt deſyred in this worlde, that was the treaſon as it was ordeyned, whan Charlemaine had red the lettre: he myghte be no gladder than he was. And of the great Ioye that he hadde of it he began to ſmyle. Syr ſayd the ſtuarde yf ye ſee oughte in the lettre that pleaſeth you not: blame not me for it. For I know not yet what it is.

Syr ſaid the chambrelain, your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement ſhal be wel doone, and than he made the lettres, as thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure had deuiſed him. And whan he had made them: the emperour Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayn ſealed them, and after he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the meſſager afore his preſence, and ſaide to him.

            <p>THan whan the meſſanger of the king yon was gone Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine made come afore hym Foulques of Moryllon, and Ogier the dane, and ſayd to them. Lordes I haue ſente for you. For I wil that ye two knowe a litill of my ſecretes.
<pb facs="tcp:7017:66"/> But I tell you vpon your faith that none other ſhall know the ſame but onely we vs three vnto the time that the deede be accomplyſhed.

Certes ſaid the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure to Ogier, ye be well worthy to knowe al, for I know you for a good and a truſty knight. Sir ſaide Ogier your good gcamercy. But I tell you that I wyll not know nothyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but that ye take fyrſte mine othe therupon. Lordes ſaid Charlemaine I take it. Nowe ſhall ye goe to the plaine of Valcolours with three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred knightes wel armed, and whan ye ſhall come there: ye ſhall finde the foure ſonnes of Aimon. And thus I commaunde you that ye brynge them to me other dead or quicke, Syr ſaide Ogier I ſaw them neuer but armed, howe ſhall we know theym? Ogier ſaide Charlemaine ye ſhal well may knowe theym. For eche of theym ſhall be clothed wyth a mantell of ſcarlette furred wyth ermynes and ſhall beare roſes in theyr handes.</p>
            <p>Syr ſaide Ogier that is a good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and we ſhal doo your commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente. They made none other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryinge but departed from the hoſte of the kinge Charlemaine as pryuelye as they myght doo. And rode to the plaine of Valcolours, and put them ſelfe in a buſſhemente wythin a woode all of ſerpyn trees, vnto the tyme that the foure ſonnes of Aimon came to the playne of Valcoloures. Ha god whye knewe not Reynawde and hys bretherne this mortall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? for they wolde not haue come there vpon mules: But they ſhoulde haue come there vpon good horſes, and well armed, as prue and worthy knightes that they were. But &amp; god had not remedied it: thys Reynawde and his bretherne ſhoulde haue been ſo one taken in a litill ſpace, for they were in daunger of death. Whan O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dane &amp; Foulques of Moryllo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in their buſhement: Foulques called his folke and ſayde to theym.

And therfore I praye you all that ye thynke to ſmite well vpon them, then ſhall I know who loueth me beſt.

            <p>NOw ſhal we telle you of the kynge yon that was at Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe. Whan he had receyued the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres of the kinge Charlemayne: he called to hym his ſecretary Godras and ſaid to him. Looke what this let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre ſayeth. And the clerke brake in continent the ſeale, and beheld the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure of the lettre, and founde howe Reynawde and hys brethern ſhould be betrayed and liuered to the death, &amp;
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:7017:66"/> whan the clerke had redde the lettre: he began to weep ſore tenderlye, and if it had not be for doubt of the king: he wolde gladly haue vttered it, and whan kinge yon ſaw his ſecretarye weep: he ſaide thus to him, keep wel vpon your lyfe that ye hide nothinge fro me, but tell me all that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre conteineth and what the kynge Charlemayne wryteth to me. By my fayth ſaid Godras. It is a ſore thing for to reherce. Nowe lightely ſayde the kyng yon, tell me what the kyng Charlemayne ſendeth me, ſyr ſayde Godras, I ſhall tell it you gladlye. And than he beganne to ſhewe to kyng yon howe Charlemayne ſente him worde, that yf he wolde doo as he had wryten vnto him: he ſhoulde encreace his power of fourtene good caſtelles more than he had. For the ſuretie wherof: he ſwereth it vnto you vpon our lorde god, and ſaint denys of Fraunce his patrone. And he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you foure mantelles of ſcarlete furred with ermines, that ye ſhall geue to the foure ſonnes of Aymon, for to were theym, &amp; thus they ſhall be knowen. For Charlemaine will not that none take any harme, but on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the foure ſonnes of Aimon. And he dooth you wyt that his folke are with in a buſhement within a woode by the plaine of Valcolours, that is to wyt Foulques of Moryllon and Ogier the dane, with three hundreth men wel horſed and well armed that abiden there foure ſonnes of Aimon, the which ye ſhould deliuer in to their handes. Whan the kinge yon vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the tenoure of the lettre: he made haſte for to fulfil his promiſe. And incontinent he lyghted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and tooke in his company a hundred men wel arraied, and tooke his waye towarde Mountawban. And as ſoone as he might: he came &amp; entred with in at the gate fletcher.</p>
            <p>And whan he was within: he made his folke to lodge them in the borow And he went vp to the palays as he was wont to doo wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cam there. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whan his ſiſter the wife of Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd wiſt of the coming of the king yon her brother: ſhe came ayenſt him and tooke him by the hand, &amp; wolde haue kiſſed him as ſhe was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doo whan he came there, but the king full of euell treaſon turned hys face a ſyde, and ſayde he had the tooth ache, and wolde not ſpeake with her but litill. But he ſayde that men ſhould make him a bedde ready. For he wolde reſt him ſelfe a lytell And whan he was layde: he began ſore to thinke, and ſaide to him ſelfe. Ha good lord, what haue I wrought ayenſt the beſt knyghtes of the world that I haue betrayed ſo falſly. Now ſhall they be hanged to morow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute faute. I pray god to haue mercy and pitie vpon them? Now maye I well ſaye that I ſhall be lykened to Iudas from hence forthe, and I ſhal haue loſte the loue of god and of hys mother, and alſo myne honour. But I muſt needes doo it ſith I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed it ſo, and the wyll of my ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons is ſuch, for thus they haue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <pb facs="tcp:7017:67"/>
            <p>AL thus as the king yon thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte in the greate treaſon that was thus machyned vpon the foure ſonnes of Aymon: there came in Reinawde from hunting, &amp; al his bretherne with him, and had taken four wild bores ſore great, and whan Reinawde was within Mountaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban: he hearde the noyſe of the horſes and wende that it had been ſtraunge knightes that were come vnto him to take wagis. And than he aſked of a yema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what folke were theſe ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>THan ſaid the good Reinawd. Ha God why hath my lorde traueylled himſelfe ſo muche for to come hither? For I wold with a good will haue gone to him. And after whan he had that ſaide: he called to him a ſeruaunte of his and ſayde to him, goe fet me my horne Boudiere. For I wyll make feaſt and Ioye for the coming of my ſouerain lorde, and incontinent it was brought to him, and Reynawde tooke it and ſayde to his bretherne, Nowe take eche of you his owne and let vs make feaſt for the loue of king yon. Than they tooke eche of them his horne and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan to ſowne all foure at ones right high, and made ſo greate noyſe that the caſtel ſowned of it.

Ha what euyll haue I wrought ayenſt theſe knightes? Alas howe make ye Ioye ayenſt ſo greate a combraunce the which I haue purchaſed to you? I haue betrayed you right falſely, as a wycked and vntrewe kynge that I am. For a man that betrayed hys freend: oughte neuer to haue honoure nother in this world nor in the other but oughte to be loſt bothe body and ſoule.

My faire brother &amp; my frend. I wil tell a counſeyll that ye know not. Nowe wyt that I haue bee at Mountbenden, and I haue ſpoken with king Charlemayne the which charged me of treaſon, by cauſe that I keep you in my realme, wherof I haue preſented my gage afore all hys company, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there ſo hardy that durſte ſpeake ayenſte that, that I ſayd. After this we had many wordes togither, among whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we ſpake of good accorde and of peace, whereof at the laſte the kyng Charlemayne was contente for my loue for to make peace with you, in the maner that foloweth. That is to were that to morow erly ye ſhal goe to the playne of Valcoloures ye and your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al vnarmed but of your ſwerdes mounted vpon youre mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and clothed with the mantelles that I haue geuen to you, and that ye ſhall beare in your handes Roſes and floures, and I ſhall ſende with you eyght of myne earles for to goe more honourably, the which ben al of my lygnage. And there ye ſhal finde the king Charlemaine, and the duke Naymes of hauyere, and Ogyer the Dane, and all the twelue Peres of Fraunce, and there Charlemayne ſhall gyue you ſuertie. And ye ſhall doo to him reuerence in ſuch maner that ye ſhal caſt your ſelfe to his feet and there he ſhall pardone, you, and he ſhall gyue you agayne all youre londes entierly.</p>
            <p>THan ſayde Reinawde, ſyr for gods mercy. For I haue greate doubt of the king Charlemaine by cauſe he hateth vs to death as ye know. And I promyſe you it he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dethe vs he ſhall make vs to die a ſhamefull death. Good freend ſaide the traytoure kynge yon, haue ye no doubte at al. For he hath ſworne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me vpon his faith afore al his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronye. Sir anſwered Reynawde we ſhall doo your commaundements. Ha God ſayde Alarde. What ſaye you my brother? ye knowe well that
<pb facs="tcp:7017:68"/> kynge Charlemayne hath made his oth many times that if he may take vs ones by ony maner of meane: he ſhall bringe vs to a ſhameful dethe. Now I meruayle me greatly of you faire brother, how ye wil accorde for to goe put your ſelfe and vs in to his handes, al vnarmed as a poore miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunte. Neuer haue god mercy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſoule, yf I goe there without mine armes, nor without to be as it apperteyneth, brother ſaid Reinawd ye ſaye not well. God forbed that I ſhould miſtruſt my lorde the kyng yon of any thing that he telleth me. And than he turned hym towarde the kyng yon and ſayde to hym. Sir without any faute we ſhall be there to morowe earlye in the mornyng, whatſoeuer happeth of it. Fayre lordes ſaid Reynawde god hath hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vs wel that we haue peace with the kynge Charlemayne to whome we haue made ſo longe time ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall a warre, but ſith that my Lorde the king you hath made thys peace: I am content to doo to him as much reuerence as to me is poſſyble. For I am delybered to goe naked in my ſmall lynen clothes to the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaynt Michael. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reinawd had ſayd this word: he toke leaue of kyng yon and went in to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of the faire lady his wife, &amp; fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there his other two brethren that were with her, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lady ſaw her huſbonde come: ſhe came ayenſt hym and tooke him betwen both her armes by great loue and kiſſed hym Lady ſayd Reynawde I ought wel to loue you by great reaſon. For your brother the king you hath trauailed hm ſelfe right ſore for me, and hathe be ſore blamed at the courte of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine for me, but he hath doone ſo muche bleſſed be god that he hathe made my peace with the king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine.

            <p>THan ſayd the lady. I thanke god greatly therof with al my hert. But tell me where the concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce ſhall be made, and hyde it not from me yf it pleaſe you. Lady ſayde Reynawde I ſhal tell it you without any faute. Wit that to morowe we muſte ryde to the playne of Valco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, &amp; there the peace ſhal be made but I and my brethren muſt goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without armes but onely oure ſwerdes, and vpon mules, berynge roſes in oure handes.

Syr yf ye wyl beleue me. ye ſhall not goe one fote there. For the plaine of Val<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>colours are ſo daungerous, for there is a roch ryght hyghe, and there ben foure grete woodes rounde aboute, yf ye will beleue me ye ſhall take a

For I dyd dreame to nyghte a dreame that was fereful &amp; merueilous, for me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that I was at the windowes of the great palace, and ſawe come out of the greate wood of Ardeyn well a thouſande wilde bores, that hadde greate and hortyble reeth, the which flewe you and rented your body al in peeces, and alſo I ſaw that the great towre of Mountawban fel downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grounde, &amp; moreouer I ſaw a ſhot of aduenture, that ſmot your brother Alarde ſo harde that it perced his body through and through, and that the chapel of Saint Nycolas which is within this caſtel fell downe to the earthe, and all the ymages that been in it wepte for greate pitte. And the two au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelles came downe from heauen that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged your brother Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde at an apple tree, and then the ſaide Richarde cried with an hyghe voice. Fayre brother Reynawd come and helpe me, and Incontinente ye went there vpon youre horſe bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde, but he fell downe by the waye vnder you, wherfore ye mightht not come time ynough, wherof ye were ful ſory. &amp; therfore good ſyr I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyle you that ye go not there.</p>
            <p>LAdye ſayde Reynawde holde your peace, for who that beleueth ouer muche in dreames: he dooth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſt the commaundemente of God. Than ſaid Alarde by the faythe that I owe to god. I ſhal neuer ſette foote there, nor I nother ſaide Rycharde, Alas ſaide than Guycharde, yf we muſt goe there: lette vs not departe thitherwarde as men of counceylle: but let vs go there lyke as prue and worthy knightes, hauing eche of vs his armes vpon him &amp; wel &amp; horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe &amp; not vpon mules: on that our brother Reinawde he well mounted vpon baiarde, which ſhal may beare vs al foure at a need, by god ſayde Reynawd ye ſhal ſay what ye wil, but I ſhal go there as I haue ſaide what ſo euer happeth, and than he went out of his chambre &amp; came to king yon, and ſaid to him. By god I merueill me muche of my brethren, that wil not go with me, becauſe they haue no horſes with them, and yf it pleaſe you ye ſhall giue vs leaue to take eche of vs a horſe &amp; ye ſhal keep ſtil your eyght earles with you, and we ſhal go there as ye haue commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded vs, I wil not doo it ſaid the kyng you, for the kyng Charlemaine dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you to ſore and youre bretherne and your horſes, &amp; alſo I haue giuen hoſtages &amp; ſuretes that ye ſhal beare no maner of harneys with you, but onely your ſwerdes as I haue tolde you afore, and that ye ſhal ride vpon mules, &amp; not vpon horſes. And yf ye go there otherwiſe arayed: Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne ſhal thinke that I wyll be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traye
<pb facs="tcp:7017:69"/> hym, and ſo ſhall he deſtroye al my lande, that ſhall be the paymente that I ſhal haue for you, I haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailled my ſelfe full ſore for to bring you and youre bretherne at one with Charlemaine, &amp; therfore go there yf ye will, and if ye wil not: leaue it.</p>
            <p>Than ſaid Reinawd, ſir ſyth that it is ſo: we ſhal go there. And than he wente from kyng yon in to his chambre again, and founde his wife that noble lady, Alard and Richarde that aſked him how he had doone, &amp; if they ſhould haue his good horſe bayarde with theym? By God ſaid Reinawde I can not haue leaue to doo ſo, but my bretherne doubte you not, for the kynge yon is a true prince, and if he ſhoulde betray vs: he ſhould be ſore blamed for it, for he ſhal make vs to be conduyted by ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of the moſte great erles of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, &amp; god confounde me yf I ſawe euer ony euil doone by him. Sir ſaid hys bretherne we ſhal goe gladly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, ſith that ye wyl haue vs needes to doo ſo. Whan they were thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded herto: thei wente to bed &amp; ſlept vnto the daye appeared, and whan Reynawde ſawe the daye: he roſe vp and ſaide to his bretherne. Ariſe ſits and make vs redy for to goe there as we ſhould goe, For yf Charlemayne be ſooner to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaines of valcolours than we: he ſhal hapely be angry for it. Syr ſayde hys bretherne, we ſhall ſoone be redy, &amp; whan they were all redy, they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the churche of ſaint Nycolas for to heare maſſe, &amp; whan it came to the offryng: Reynawde &amp; his bretherne offred many ryche gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And after the maſſe was done: they aſked after theyr mules &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent they mounted vpon, &amp; in their felowſhip were eyght earles, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che knewe all the maner of treaſon. &amp; whan they were all mounted they tooke on theyr way but the foure ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aymon were good to knowe by the other, for they had on greate mantelles of ſcarlet turred with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynes, &amp; bare in their handes roſes in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peace &amp; alſo their ſwerdes for they wold not gyrde theim. Now god be with them, for if he keep them not: they bene in waye of perdycyon &amp; neuer to come againe to Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban. whan the king yon ſawe them thus go: he fell downe in a ſwount more then foure times, for the great ſorowe that he had at his hearte, for how be it that he had betrayed them ſo: yet had he great pitie of them, but this that he had doone. euyl counſeyl had made him doo it. And than he be: gan to make the greateſt ſorow in the worlde, &amp; ſaid, ha good lorde what haue I doone? dyd euer man ſo great treaſon as I haue doone? nay verely for I haue betrayed the beſt knyghts of the world, and the moſte worthye and true.</p>
            <p>THan ſayde his folke. Syr ye doo not wel to make ſuche a ſorowe, for Reynawde is very wiſe &amp; he ſhal it perceiue ryght ſoone. Ha god ſayd the king yon, were it as ye ſaye, for I ſhoulde be more gladde than yf I had wonne tenne of the beſt cyties of Fraunce, for Reynaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de is my freend and my brother.

            <p>NOw begynneth the piteous hyſtory of the foure ſonnes of Aimon that wente to theyr deathe by the meanes of the traytour kyng yon.

Now ſhall I tell you of Reynawde and of his brethren, than tode Reynawde and his brethren towarde the plaine of Valcolours, and as they toode thitherwardi Alarde began to ſyng ryghte ſweetly and Ioyfull a newe ſonge, and Guycharde and Rychard dyd in lykewiſe, but I tell you that no inſtrument of muſike ſowned ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo melodyouſlye as the three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren dyd ſyngyng to gither, alas what pyty was it of ſo noble and ſo worthy knightes that went ſinging and makyng Ioy to their death, they were as the ſwanne that ſyngeth that yere that ſhe ſhall die, Reynawd went behynde them ſore thynkyng, hys head bowed down towarde the earth, and beheide hys brethern that rode forth makyng great Ioye, and he ſayd, o god what knyghtes be my brethrene that there been none ſuche in all the world, nother ſo gracyous? And whan he had ſaide this: he ſette his hands together and heued them vp towarde heauen all weping, and ſaide in this maner, good lord by thy gloryous and bleſſed name that did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt caſt daniell out fro the lyons, &amp; delyuered Ionas fro the fyſhes bely and ſaued ſaynt Peter whan he caſt himſelfe from the ſea for to come to the &amp; pardoned Mary magdalene, &amp; and made the blinde to ſee, &amp; ſuffred paſſion &amp; deathe vpon the croſſe for our ſinnes, &amp; pardoned Longyus y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſmot thee with a ſpere in to thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſide, wherfro thy bleſſed bloud fel in to his eyen, and incontinent he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered his ſyght therby, and by thy reſurreccion, keep this day my body if it pleaſe the fro deth and from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and alſo my brethren for I wote not where that we goe, but me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that we go in great peryl. And whan he had fynyſhed his oryſon: his eyne wexed were againe for pitie that he had, leaſt his brethren ſhould haue any harme for loue of him. For it pleſed him not wel, that thei were ſo bare of their armes.</p>
            <p>THan whan Alarde ſaw his brother Reynawde that had his eyne ful of teres, he ſayed to him Ha brother what ayleth you I haue ſen you in right great peril &amp; aboute
<pb facs="tcp:7017:70"/> a harde werke, but I ſawe you neuer make ſo yl cheere as ye doo now, for I haue ſeen you weep at this houre. wher of I meruail me greatly, for I wot wel for certayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye weep not without ſome great occaſion. Than ſayd Reynawde. Fayre brother me ayleth nothinge. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithe that I owe to you ſayd Alarde ye weep not for nothynge. This is the daie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſholde be at one with kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, ſo pray I you for god my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re brother that ye leue this ſorowe, &amp; let vs go forth mereli and bere out a good face as longe as we ben alyue, for after that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ones deceaſſed it is no more ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him. And this I praye you bretherne that ye ſynge with vs. For ye haue ſo fayre a voice that it is a great pleaſure for to heare you ſyng, whan ye be wyllinge to it. Brother ſaid Reinawde with a good wyll, ſyth that it pleaſeth you. And than began Reynawde for to ſynge ſo melodiouſli: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for to here hym. So longe rode the foure ſonnes of Aymon the lytell pace of their mules, ſyngyng and deuiſnge amonge theymſelfe: that they came to the playne of Valco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Now wyl I tel you of the facion of the valey, for wyt that if I telled you not: ye ſhoulde not maye know it.

And therfore the treaſon was there deuyſed, for thys playne of Valcolours was ferre fro all folke, &amp; there was a way croſſed in foure, the one waye was towarde Fraunce, the other in to Spaine, the other in to Galyce, and the fourth in to Gaſcoygne. And at euery one of theſe foure wayes: was layde a buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhement oſ .v. hundred men wel hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and armed for to take Reinawde and his brethren quicke or deade, for thus had they ſworne it, &amp; promiſed to kyng Charlemayne. Than come there Reinawd &amp; his bretheren with theyr felawſhyp of eyght erles, that the kynge yon of Gaſcoyne had take to them, the whiche wiſt well al the miſtery of this treaſon.

            <p>THan wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reinawd and his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were come there, and found no body: they were of it ſore a baſhed. And after whan Alarde ſaw this: he called his brother Rychard
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:7017:70"/> and ſayd to him. what is this fayre brother I ſe well that we ben berrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for I ſe you chaunge your colour, how think ye? Brother ſaid Richard I doubt me ſore for Reynawd, haue no doubt ſaid Alarde. For we ſhall haue nothyng but good.

Brother ſaid Alard what tary ye ſo longe, for they bene well worthy for to die, ſith that they ben traitours. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rainawde vnderſtood that word of his brother: he ſette hande to his ſwerde &amp; ſmote the earle of Anſom ſo great a ſtroke vpon the head that he cloued hym to the harde teeth, and it was well rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for it was he that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeyled this treaſon to the kinge you, that was the rewarde that he had for the firſt, whan the earle of Anſom was thus ſlaine: the other ſeuen began to flee,

And yf ye make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſemblaunt to defende youre ſelfe: I ſhall ſlea you incontinent.</p>
            <p>FOulques ſayde Reinawd ye ſpeke well lyke a beaſt, and trow you that I ſhal yelde me quicke to Charlemayne or to you? I ſhall fyrſt ſmite of your heade &amp; the helme withal if I can rech to you, ye know well howe my ſwerde cutteth. By god Foulques ſayd Reynawd ye are greatly to be blamed for to haue gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the counſeyll for to make vs to be betrayed by the kynge you, for it is the fouleſt crafte that a knyghte may for to doo treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But doo as a gentilman ought to doo, to the ende that men ſay not that it is treaſon, yf ye will lette vs goe: we ſhall be all foure ready to become liegemen of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Charlemayne, and I ſhal gyue you my horſe Bayarde, the whiche I gaue not for all the golde in the world, and alſo I ſhal gyue you the ſtrong caſtel Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban, and if the kyng Charlemayne maketh warre ayenſt you for loue of vs: we ſhall ſerue you with fyue hundred knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes well armed and well horſed euer more, and if it pleaſe you ye ſhal ſaue vs our liues. And yf ye will not doo this: doo another thyng that I ſhall tell you for to keep you to bee not called a traytoure. Cheſe .xx. knygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the beſt that ye haue, and put theym in a feeld well armed, vpon good horſes, &amp; we foure ſhal fyghte with them vnarmed as we ben vpon our mules, and yf your .xx. knightes well armed and well horſed may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome me and my brethren though we haue no harneis vpon vs: we pardone them our deathe, and yf god wyll that we ſhould ouercome them: that ye ſhould than lette vs goe free where we wolde, it is that I requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you for goddes loue and for youre worſhyppe and no more, and yf ye doo not ſo: ye ſhal be taken for an yll knyght all dayes of your lyfe.

Than ſaide A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larde to Reynawde, brother what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denaunce ſhal we keep? brother (ſaid Rainawd) we ſhal kep foote troo and two: ye and Guycharde ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde, and I and Rycharde ſhall make the forewarde, and lette vs ſmite well harde I pray you, for the time is now com that we muſt needs doo ſo, and make we that thyng that
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:7017:72"/> ſhalbe lefte in perpetuall memory to them that ſhalbe after vs, ſith that by no wyſe we may not ſcape. Faire brother ſaide Alarde to Guycharde, ye were wel deceiued for that ye tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that Reinawd had betraied vs. I promiſe you he wold not doo it for all the golde of the worlde. By my fayth ſaid than Guycharde to Alard I am now well whole, ſith that our deare brother Reynawde ſhall be to our helpe, for as longe as he ſhall be a liue: we ſhall defende our ſelfe, but not after, for thoughe I might choſe I wolde not liue after he were dead. And whan he had ſayed thys: they medled themſelfe amonge theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Shortly to ſpeake of the foure ſonnes of Aimon aſſembled wel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſt three hundred good knightes, but their courage were neuertheleſſe therfore as longe as they had lyfe in the body: but that they ſhewed vnto their enemies a knightes face, whan Foulques of Morylion ſawe Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde come: he ſpurred his horſe with the ſpurres &amp; bare his ſpeare a low, &amp; went &amp; ſmot Reynawd by the mantell of ſcarlet that was aboute his arme ſo great a ſtroke that hys ſpere entred through his thygh and ouerthrewe bothe hym and his mule to the earthe. Whan Alarde ſaw the ſtroke: he cried ſore and ſayde. Alas we haue loſt Reynawde our brother that was al our hope and our ſecour now may we not eſcape, but that we ſhall be dead or taken, and it is better that we yelde vs pryſoners at this time: than to defende vs anye more. For ſith it is ſo: oure defence ſhall helpe vs nothynge ayenſt ſo many folke. And whan Reynawde vnderſtod the wordes of his brother, he cryed to him with a loude voyce and ſayd. Fie vpon you glutto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what is that ye ſay? I haue no harme yet, but I am al whole as ye be, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked be god, and yet ſhall I telle me full dere or I die. And whan Reynawde had ſaied this: he roſe vp quickelye and tooke the ſpere with both his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and pulled it oute of his thyghe with great greef, and after ſet hande to his ſwerde. And ſayde to Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Moryllon, knyght if ye will doo like a good man: light a foote as I am. And ye ſhall knowe what I can doo. Whan Foulques of Moril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon vnderſtode him: he turned vpon him ſore an angred, and thought for to haue ſmitten him on hys heade, but Reynawde drewe a litell aſyde, and wente and gaue vnto Foulques ſuche a ſtroke vpon hys helme: that nother yron nor ſtele myght not ſaue hym, but that Renawde cloue hym in to the harde teeth and felled him deade to the catthe. And whan he ſawe him falle: he ſayde vnto hym. Nowe vnhappy Traytoure that thy ſoule may haue no pardone, but goe to the pyt of helle. And whan he had ſaied that: he tooke the horſe of Foul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques of Moryllon the whiche was right good, &amp; lighte vpon it inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and tooke his ſheeld &amp; his ſpere that Foulques of Moryllon had ſho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued through and through his thyghe &amp; than he ſayd to his brethren. Be ye al ſure that as longe as I am a lyue: ye ſhal haue no harme, but the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemen ſhal ſaye that they haue an ylle neyghboure of me. And wyt it
<pb facs="tcp:7017:73"/> whan he was an horſbacke: he was not well at eaſe, becauſe that the ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roppes were to ſhorte for him. But he had other thinges to doo, than for to make them lenger. And whan he was thus ſet on horſbacke: he made his horſe to renne and held his ſpere alowe, and went and mette with the earle Angenon by ſuche maner that he put both yron and wood throughe the breſt of him ſo that he muſt fall down dead fro the horſe to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d afore his foote. And after Reinawd ſet hande to his ſwerde, and ſmote a knighte ſuche a ſtroke that his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me might not ſaue him, but cleued hym to the teeth. What ſhall I tell you more? Nowe wit it that at that time Renawde ſlewe wyth his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des foure earles, thre dukes and ſixe knightes, and after he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to crye Mountawban with a hye voice. And after his crye: he went &amp; ſmote Roberte the lorde of Dygeon that was ſonne to the duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goine ſo that the head with the helme he made it lepe to the grounde, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſlewe a nother ſterke dead, that came to reſcue the ſaid lorde.</p>
            <p>ANd whan Rainawde hadde doone this noble proweſſe: he behelde about him, and trowed to haue ſeen his brethren than, but he ſaw none of them, wherof he was ſore abaſſhed. O god ſayd he where are my brethren gone? nowe be they well ferre from me, we ſhall neuer come togither again. And than came there Alarde that in likewyſe had wonne a horſe, the ſheeld and the ſpere, for he had ſlaine a knight, and had taken his hors, but he was ſore hurte. Neuertheleſſe he came &amp; held ſide with his brother, and Rycharde and Guycharde came ſoone at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. Than Alarde ſaide to Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde. Brother be al ſure that we ſhall neuer faile you to the deth. And whan the foure brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither againe: they began to make ſo great diſtruccion of frenſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that none durſte abyde theym. For all they that they hytte: ſcaped not the death. whan the frenſhemen ſawe this: they were meruailled, and ſaid the one to the other. By my ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le this paſſeth all other wunder. I trow that they ben no knightes: but that they be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuils, now let vs make to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a ſawte both behinde and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for if they liue long: they ſhall do vs greate hurte. And whan they were hereto, accorded: they ranne all vpon the foure ſonnes of Aymon ſo harde that they parted them woulde they or not. But Reynawde paſſed throughe them al and broughte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of the preſe, and Alarde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hym. And Rycharde retourned fleeing toward the roche Mountbro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Guychard abode there on foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ANd whan Reynawde ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys enemyes led his brother Guycharde ſo ſhamefully: he wexed almoſte madde for angre, and called his brother Alarde to him and ſaid, Fayre brother what ſhal we doo? ſee how ſhamefully they fare with our brother Guycharde, yf we ſuffre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to brynge hym forth of this facyon: we ſhall neuer haue worſhyp in our dayes. Brother ſayd Alarde I wote not what we maye beſt doo for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde or for to goe to them. For I tel you that we be no mo but two, and they be ſo great nombre of folke that wee can doo nothing agaynſt them. O god (ſayd Reynawde) what ſhall I doo if the king Charlemaine make my brother to be hanged? I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be at my hertes caſe, nor I ſhall neuer come to no courte, but men ſhal poynte me with the fynger, and ſhall ſaye ſee yonder is the ſonne of Aymon that let his brother to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And whan Reynawde heard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>: he caſt his ſheeld behinde him, and habandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his body all boldely as a Lyon, and cared not how the game ſhould go, for ye ſaw neuer wood men hew in a foreſt, nor make ſo great noyſe as Reynawde made with his ſwerde amonge his enemyes for he cutted &amp; hewed legges and armes by ſuche wyſe that no man ſhould beleue it, but they that ſee it.

Let goe the knyghte ye yll folkes, for ye be not worthye to touche hym, and whan they that led Guycharde ſawe come Reynawde: they were ſore afrayed that they put them ſelfe to flight &amp; left Guycharde free and ſayde the one to the other. here cometh the ende of the worlde. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde ſaw that they fled: the ſayd to Alarde. Goe ye fayre brother and vnbinde Guicharde our brother and ſet him vpon this horſe and gyue him a ſpere in his hande, &amp; come after me, for the traytours ben dyſcomfyted. Brother ſayd Alarde. I ſhall goe where it pleaſe you, but I tell you yf we parte one from the other: we ſhall neuer come together agayne ſeyng that we be ſo few &amp; ſo yll armed, but let vs keep together, &amp; helpe thone thother. Brother ſayde Reynawde ye ſay well &amp; wiſely, and we ſhal doo it. And than they wente bothe together to Guycharde, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde
<pb facs="tcp:7017:74"/> hym, and made him mounte on horſebacke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſheelde at the necke, and the ſpere in the hande. Now goe there the three brethern together, and the fourth fighteth agaynſt a greate nombre of folke, that was the valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Richarde, that was the moſte worthy of all after hys brother Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde. But men had ſlaine his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le vnder hym, and was wounded ryght ſore. But he had ſlayne fiue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and well .xiiii. knyghtes, wherof he was ſo ſore trauayled and ſo we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he might not all moſte defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de himſelfe no more, but went rounde aboute the roche. And than came ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarde of valcome that was coſyn to Foulques of Moryllon the whyche he had founde dead, wherof he made great ſorowe, &amp; ſayd. Ha gentyl kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it is great domage of your deth. Certes he that hath brought you to this death he is not my freend. Now ſhal I auenge me if I maye, &amp; than he came to the roche. And whan he ſaw Reynawde in ſo great greefe: he ſpurred his horſe with his ſpurres &amp; bare his ſpere alowe &amp; ſmote Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde through the mantell of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, that he wrapped aboute his lifte arme ſo harde that the ſpere entred ferre in his bodye ſo muche that he brought hym to the erth, and as he drewe hys ſpere agayne: the guttes of Richarde came out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body into his lappe, &amp; the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de was ſo great that the lyuer and the lounges appe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red. Than began Gerarde to crye. No ware dyſcoupled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure ſonnes of Aymo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for I haue ſlayne Richard the hardy fighter, all the other ſhall ſoone be ſlayne or taken, yf god giue me helth. And I ſhall brynge them vnto the kynge Charlemayne, that ſhal make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be hanged at Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fawcon as ſoone as he hath them.</p>
            <p>THan whan Richarde was come a lytle to his eſe: he roſe vp quyckely vpon hys feete, &amp; tooke hys bowelles with bothe his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and put them agayne into his belye and after ſet hande to hys ſwerde, &amp; came to Gerarde and ſayd to hym in great angre. Thou curſed man thou ſhalt haue thy rewarde anon for that ye haue doon to me, for certes it ſhal not be vmbrayed to Reynawde that ye haue ſlayne his brother, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſayde thus: he ſmote Gerarde through the quyras, and throughe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſheelde ſo great a ſtrooke, that he he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the ſhouldre and the arme with all from the body &amp; felled hym down dead to the erth afore hys feete, and than ſayd to him. Certes Gerarde it had be better for you that ye had not come hytherwarde, for to the kynge Charlemayne now ſhal ye not beare your boſte that ye haue ſlayne one of the foure Sonnes of Aymon. And whan he had ſayd that: he fel downe in a ſwonne, and whan he was come agayne to hymſelfe: he began for to wiſſhe after hys brethern, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned them ſore, ſayinge. O Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde fayre brother this daye ſhall departe our company. For I ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer ſee you, nother ye me. O Caſtell of Mountawban I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende thee to god that he wil by his mercy &amp; pitie bringe agayne your lorde ſaufe and ſounde of his body. Ha king yon of Gaſcoygne, whye haue ye betrayed
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:7017:74"/> vs? and taken vs to the kyng Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne: certes ye dyd therin greate ſyn, and aſhamfull fault, and after he ſayd all weeping. O father king of glory, and lorde of al the worlde, ſuccoure this day my poore brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. For I wot not where they ben, nor of me they may neyther haue he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lpe nor ſuccors, for I am all redy for to dye.</p>
            <p>NOwe ſhall I tell you of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde of Alarde, and of Gui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>charde that faught ſtrongly agaynſt theyr enemies, as worthy knightes that they were. But all theyr great faytes of armes ſhould auayled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothinge yf they had not come to a narowe way of the Roche, where men myght not come to them but a fore. And whan they had be longe there: Reynawde began to ſay to his brother Alarde, Brother where is be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come our brother Richarde that we ſaw not of a good whyle a goe? now thinke none other but that we ſhall neuer ſee him, for I left him heere bi thys ſapyn tree, whan ye and I had ſo much to doo. I praye god yf he be dead that he haue his ſoule. Now I wyl wit tidinges of him yf it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Brother ſayd Alarde yf ye wyll beleue me ye ſhall abyde heere, God pardon him if he be dead, for we mai not helpe him the perill is to greate and I beleue that we ſhould dy afore that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were come. Ha brother ſayd Reynawde ſhall we fayle to our bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Richarde the good knight and worthy? Than ſayde Alarde, what will ye that we ſhall doo therto? for as to me I knowe no remedy to it. Alas ſayde Reynawde ye ſpeake fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhly, for I ſhould not doubt for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of death to wit where he is becom And if I ſhould goe alone, yet ſhall I vnderſtand ſome tidinges of him. Brother ſaid Alarde I promiſe you if we depart the one from the other: We ſhall neuer ſee vs agayne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Brother ſayd Reynawde other dead or all quicke, I ſhall finde him where ſo euer he be it maye none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, and whan Reynawde had ſayde theſe wordes: he ſpurred hys horſe wyth his ſpurres, and cam at the other ſide of the roche. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they that had chaſed Richarde there for to ſlea him ſaw Reinawde come: they ſmote hemſelfe to flight, &amp; than Reynawde wente a lytle more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vpon the roche, and founde there his brother Richarde that laye nyghe dead vpon the ground, &amp; helde his bowelles betwene his handes, and about him were a great numbre of folke which he had ſlayne. Whan Reynawde ſaw him dead and ſo ſore wounded: he had of it ſo great ſorow at hys hert that almoſte he fell down dead to the grounde but he tooke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and cam nighe his brother and lyghted downe from his horſe &amp; kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſore weeping and ſayd. Ha fayre brother it is great pitie &amp; dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of you and of your death for certes neuer man was worthe you, for yf ye had come to mans age ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Rowlande nor Olyuer were ſo prue in knighthode, as ye ſhuld haue be. Alas now is loſt our beauty and our youthe thorough greate ſynne. O good lorde who ſhould euer haue thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onye treaſon ſhould haue
<pb facs="tcp:7017:75"/> entred into the hert of the king yon? Alas my brother Rycharde woe is me for your death, for I am cauſe of it. Alas thys daye in the mornynge whan wee departed out of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban we were foure bretherne al good knightes, now are we but .iii. that ben perillouſli wounded and al vnarmed. Nowe God forbed that I ſhould ſcape ſythe that ye be dead v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the traytours. But I pray god that I may venge your death vpon them or euer I deceaſſe. For I ſhall ſet therto my good will, &amp; if god will it ſhalbe ſo. Euen thus as Reinawde made mone ouer hys brother: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde behynde hym and ſawe come his brethern Alarde and Guycharde all diſcomfyted, that cryed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde. Brother what doo you? com anon and help vs for we haue great need. And whan Richarde heard the voyce of Alarde: he opened his eyen, and whan he ſaw his brother Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde afore hym: he ſayd to hym. O brother Reinawde and what doo you heere? ſee ye yonder that roche which is ſo hyghe and ſo ſtronge, where as ben manye ſmall ſtones aboue, yf we myght doo ſo muche that we cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vp there: I beleue that we ſhold be ſafe from our enemies, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but our coſyn Mawgys kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth our diſeaſe by thys: and he ſhal come to ſuccour vs. Brother ſayde Reynawde wolde god we were there now tell me my fayre brother howe feele ye your ſelfe? thinke ye that ye maye recouer healthe? yea ſayde Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde yf ye ſcape and els not, for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſore that I haue, I myght well dye for ſorowe.</p>
            <p>ANd whan Reynawde heard Richarde ſpeake thꝰ: he was ryght glad of it. So called he Alard to him and ſayde. Brother take Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde vpon your ſheelde, and lede hym vpon the roche, and Guicharde and I ſhall rowme the waye a fore you, brother ſayde Alarde, doubt not I ſhall doo my power. And than he lighted downe and tooke vp Richard and layde hym vpon hys ſheeld, and after he lighted againe on horſbacke and Reynawde and Guycharde leyd hym with his brother vpon the horſe necke, and after put them ſelfe afore to breake the prece of the Frenche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And they did ſo muche that they came to the roche. But wyt it well that Reynawde made there ſo great faytes armes, that all hys enemyes were meruaylled with all. For he ſlewe at that tyme wel thyrty knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that neuer wylde Bore, nor ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, nor Lyon, nor Bere dyd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde made there of his body. But for to ſay the trouthe: Reynawde ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nought by his lyfe, and ieoparde himſelf al together, for he was as a man deſperate. And whan they were come to the roche, Alarde ſet downe his brother Rychard to the erth. And began to defende quyckly, but I wot not how they might endure, for they had nother Caſtell nor fortreſſe, but onlye the roche.</p>
            <p>ALl thus as the three brethern defended theymſelfe wyth greate woe. Than came there Ogier
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:7017:75"/> the dane and hys folke, and had in his company Magon of Friſe with well a thouſande knyghtes, &amp; cryed vpon Reynawde. Certes knight ye ſhalbe dead wee haue ſworne your death. This day is the departyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye &amp; your brethern ſhall ſuffre death Ye did as fooles whan ye beleued the kynge You, for he hath put you all to death. Whan Alarde ſaw ſo great folke come: he was ſore an angred, and ſayd to Guycharde. See howe great a ſorow is heere afore vs, and the great nombre of folke that be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy for to ſlea vs foure knightes. cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes yf we were fyue hundred wel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med yet ſhould not we ſcape, for they ben wel armed and a great quantiti of knightes. Surely ſayd Guichard heere is a meruaylouſe companye, but yf God helpe vs nowe: wee ben com to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of our dayes. It is no great dommage of me nother of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde, but the great dommage is of Reynawde that is the beſt knyghte of the worlde. And whan Alarde and Guycharde had ſpoken togyder: they wente to Reynawde and kyſſed him full ſore wepynge, and ſayde vnto hym O brother Reynawde giue vs a gyfte yf it pleaſe you for the loue of oure lorde God. Lordes ſayde Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde what thynge aſke you of me? ye know wel ynough that I can not helpe you of no thing, and thys day muſte I needes ſee you dye before min eyen.</p>
            <p>BRother ſaid Alarde, Herke what we wyll tell you, and yf it pleaſe you ye ſhall doo it. Say on hardely ſayde Reynawde. Brother ſayde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larde men ſayen comenly that it is better to doone one harme: than two I ſay thys bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if ye dye heere: it ſhalbe great dommage, &amp; the loſſe ſhal neuer be recouered agayne, for none ſhall auenge your death, but though we dye heere and not you: it ſhalbe no great domage, for ye ſhal auenge vs wel, and therfore we pray you ſweet brother for al the pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res that ye wolde doo euer to vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye wyll goe your wayes, and wee ſhall abyde heere. And whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death ſhal come; we ſhall take it a worthe. This that we ſay ye may well doo: for ye be well horſed, and ye ſhal wel ſaue your ſelfe maugre the Frenche men, yf they goe to Mountawban, &amp; whan ye be at Mountawban: lyght vpon Bayarde well armed, &amp; bringe anon wyth you our coſyn Mawgys for to ſuccour vs. Brother ſayd Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, ye ſpeake to folyſhlye. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes I wolde not doo ſo for all the golde of the worlde. I ſhould be ſore bad and full vnkynde yf I dyd ſo, for I coulde not ſpyll my ſelfe ſouer than for to leaue you in ſo great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll. Other we ſhall all ſcape: or els we ſhal all dye together, for the one ſhall not fayle the other as longe as we may lyue, now God that ſuffred death and paſſion ſaue vs. Thus as Reynawde ſpake to hys bretherne: came the erle Guymarde to whome God gyue euyl aduenture, and ſayd to Reynawde, knight ye be take and ye muſt dye wyth ſhame vpon thys roche. Whan ye beleued the kynge You ye dyd great foly. He wrought great treaſon whan he dyd ſell you to the kynge Charlemayne that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:7017:76"/> you ſo muche, for ye loued hym more, than ye dyd your coſin Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys. He hath well rewarded you for the great loue that ye ought to him, tell me Reynawde whether ye wyll yeeld you or defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de you? Certes ſayd Reynawde now ſpeke ye for nought, I ſhall neuer yeeld me as longe as I am a liue. Reynawde ſayd than, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyer what wyll ye doo? wee cannot helpe you of nothynge, other gyue your ſelfe vp: or defende your ſelfe, Ogyer ſayd Reynawde, by hym that made the worlde I ſhall neuer yeeld me. I was neuer no theefe and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wyl I not be hanged, I haue le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dye like a knyght than to hange lyke a theefe. Lordes ſayd Guimard let vs ſawte them, for they ſhall not may kepe longe agaynſt vs. Lordes ſayd Ogyer ye maye well ſawte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if ye wil, but bi my ſoule I ſhal doo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothyng, for they ben my coſins nor I ſhall not helpe theym. For ye ſhall take them well wythout me. Certes ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frenche men, we ſhall than aſſayle them worthely. Than Ogyer drewe hymſelfe and all hys folke a ſyde, wel the length of a bow ſhot, and began to make ſo great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe as thoughe all the worlde had finiſſhed afore hys eyen, and all hys ſorow was for Reynawde hys co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyn and for hys brethern, and thus as he made his mone: he began for to ſaye. Ha fayre coſin Reynawde it is great pitie of your death. And I vnhappy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that am of your kynne ſuffre you to dye afore myne eyen, &amp; yet I cannot helpe you, for I haue it promyſed to Charlemayne, nor I ought not for to breake myne othe. But the hiſtorye telleth that Ogyer duaange himſelfe greatly that day, And through his purchace the foure ſonnes of Aymon ſcaped. For yf he wolde haue put payne to it: they ſhould not haue ſcaped by no maner but as men ſayd. True bloud maye not lye.</p>
            <p>BEfore the roche were foure Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, for to ſawte the foure Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aymon, and made them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a doo. For theyr folke ſawted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in foure partyes. Wherof Reynawde kepte the two partes: and Alarde &amp; Guycharde kepte the other tweyne. For Richarde lay downe vpon the erth ſore wounded, as I tolde you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And yet was Guicharde wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſore throughe the thye wherof he had bled ſo longe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye was feynt and fell downe to the erth. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſawe that he myght no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: he began to cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde and ſayde. Ha Reynawde fayre bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let vs yeeld vs I pray you, for I nor Richarde maye no more helpe you. Brother ſayd Reynawde what ſay you? now ſhew ye wel that ye be ferdfull, but I let you wyt that yf I trowed to ſcape other for Golde, or for Syluer or for Citie or for Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, or my horſe Bayarde that I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſo muche: I ſhould haue yeeld me priſoner to daye in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mornynge. For ye wot well that yf we ben take that all the golde that is in all the worlde ſaue vs not fro hangynge, or ſome other ſhamefull death, and therfore I wyll not yeeld me by no maner of wyſe. A man that wylbe valyaunte
<pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:7017:76"/> ought to defende hymſelfe for to be whole. Ha Richarde ſuccour vs for the loue of Ieſus, for wee haue well miſtre: we ben nother Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nor Bretons, but we ben all of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of one mother. Now ought we well to helpe eche other with all our power for our worſhip, for other wyſe men ſhould ſay that we ben ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardes, and of an yll father. ye ſaye trouthe ſayde Guicharde. But ye wolde not beleue how feble I am, for I am wounded to the death.</p>
            <p>Certes ſayde Reynawde, I am ſory for it, but I ſhall defende you as longe as life is in my bodi, who had ſeen than the noble knight Reinawd take vp the great ſtones, and caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon hys enemyes: ye wolde not haue ſayd that he had not be wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded nor trauayled of nothing. Whan Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde (that lay a ground thus wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as I haue tolde you aboue) ſaw and heard the great noyſe that they that ſawted the roche made: he tooke vp his head and ſayd to Reynawde. Brother I ſhall helpe you. But cut me ſome of my ſherte, &amp; I ſhal binde my ſyde and wounde ſo that my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles may not yſſue out of my beli and than I ſhal ſet me to mi defence and ſhall helpe you with al my hert. Than ſayd Reynawde, nowe art y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> well worthe a true man. And whan Guycharde vnderſtoode hym: he was a ſhamed and tooke agayne ſtrength in him beyonde hys power and came to the defence and ſayde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a high voice Ogier fayre coſin what doo you to your lynage? Certes it ſhalbe a great ſhame to you yf ye ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cour vs not, for the faute that ye doo to vs: ſhall be layde vnto you in euery place where ye goe, to let vs dye thus we that ben your kynneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the beſt of all the worlde, ſaue Reynawde &amp; ye ſhall doo like a true man, and as for vs other: it maketh nother leſſe nother more. Whan O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier vnderſtode theſe wordes: he was ſory for it, that no man might more, and wolde haue gyue a great thing for to haue deliuered them. And ſaid that he wolde doo wyth all his herte all that he might doo for them. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ogyer ſpurred Brayforde with his ſpurres and came to the roche w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſtaffe in his hande, and ſayde to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſawted the roche: wythdraw your ſelfe a litle tyll I haue ſpoken wyth them a litle, for to wyt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they wyll giue them ſelfe vp or no. For it is better that we haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quicke than dead. Sir ſayd the Fren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che men we ſhal doo your commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. But wee leaue them wyth you to keep in the name of the kynge Charlemayne. Ha god ſayd Ogier I neuer thought treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor I ſhal not begyn yet. And than he came more nighe the roche than he had be, and called to hym the foure Sonnes of Aymon, and ſayd to theym. Fayre coſyn reſt you, and take agayne your brethe, and yf ye be hurt: wrappe vp your woundes, &amp; make good garniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinge of ſtones, &amp; ſo defende youre ſelfe nobly of al your power, for if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Charlemayne may haue you: ye ſhall neuer haue pardonne, but he ſhal make you to be hanged &amp; ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and therfore ye muſte needes
<pb facs="tcp:7017:77"/> kepe your ſelfe well. For I promiſe you yf Mawgis know of it: he ſhall come to ſoccoure you, thus ſhall ye ſcape. &amp; other wyſe not. Coſen ſayd Alarde, ye ſhall haue of it a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde yf euer we may ſcape, ye ſaye true ſayde Reynawde. For yf I mai ſcape bi god that ſuffred death &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon for vs vpon the Croſſe, all the golde of the world ſhal not ſaue him but I ſhall ſlea hym wyth myne own handes, for I hate hym much more than I doo a ſtraunger. For he that ſhould helpe and defende me agaynſt all men it is he that doth me harme Coſyn ſayd Ogyer I maye not doo therto, ſo helpe god my ſoule. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng Charlemayne made me ſwere afore all hys barons that I ſhould not helpe you in no maner of wyſe. And of this that I doo, I am ſure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the kynge Charlemayne ſhall conne me no thanke. Brother ſayd Alarde Ogyer telleth you trouth. And alſo it was well trouth that Ogyer was repreued therof for treaſon, for char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine called him traitour afore al his barons.

But the wounde of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde was ſo greefully to ſee that it was pitie to beholde, for all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayles appered oute of hys bodye. And whan he had lapped theym al: Alarde wrapped the wounde that Reynawde had in the thyghe, and whan they had reſted themſelf a litle Reynawde ſtoode vp and went vpon the roche for to gather ſtones to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende them ſelf.

Whan the Erle Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marde hearde Ogyer ſpeake ſo: he wente to hym &amp; ſayd. We commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de you in the kinges name of Fraunce that ye come to the batayle wyth vs agaynſt the foure ſonnes of Aymon as ye haue promiſed and ſworne, &amp; for doubt of you many a lord is here in your company that wyll not fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght.

I pray you let vs withdrawe our ſelfe a backe, and let them be in peace, and I ſhall gyue eche of you large goodes, Ogier ſaid the frenche men we ſhall not doo ſo, but we ſhall brynge them pryſoners to the kynge Charlemayne that ſhal doo with them hys pleaſure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we ſhall tell him what ye haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one. Wherof he ſhall conne you lytle thanke all his life. And after whan Ogier vnderſtode theſe wordes: he was ſore an angred &amp; ſayde by great wrathe. By the fayth that I owe to al my freendes if there be ani of you ſo hardy that take Reynawde or any of this brethern for to delyuer them to king Charlemayne I: ſhall ſmyte of his head, what ſome euer come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.

And whan we haue them: we ſhal ſee who ſhal take them from vs, for we ſhall well can ſhewe this to the king Charlemain. And than they began to ſawt the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che agayne. Wit it that Reynawde &amp; hys brethern defended themfelf full nobly. But whan Reynawde ſawe this great multytude of folke that came for to ſawte them: he began to ſaye. Ha Mawgis my fayre coſyn where are ye now that ye knowe not thys myſhap? for ye wolde come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to helpe vs: but ye know it not, wherof I am euyll contente. For I was a foole and ouer haſty that I ſpake not to you of thys matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I came heere. Ha Bayarde yf I were vpon your backe I ſhould neuer entre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in this roche for feare of the frenchemen, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne ſhould leſe heere of the beſt knyghtes of his company, &amp; whan he had ſayde this: he began to weepe full tenderly for the loue of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſaw ſo ſore wounded and &amp; ſo werye.

Whan the ſawtinge was finiſſhed: Reynawde ſet himſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his defence, for he was ſo wery that if he had gone he ſhould haue fallen downe to the erthe, ſo weke he was and that was no meruayle: for they had ſo ſore trauayled him, &amp; had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred ſo many tormentes and terrible ſawtes that it was wunder y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they coulde endure ſo longe.</p>

            <p>NOw ſheweth the hyſtory that whan Godarde ſaw Reynaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and his brethern go to theyr death thorough ſo falſe a treaſon: he had of it great ſorowe and pitie, and he was ryght ſory for it, for two pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſes, wherof thone was for his mayſter the kynge Yon, that had wrought that ſhamefull treaſon: and the other was for the great pitie and domage y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was for to make die ſo pitiouſly ſuche worthy knyghtes as the foure ſonnes of Aimon were. So began he to weep pitiouſly, and thus as he wept, came there Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys the coſyn of the foure ſonnes of Aymon that went to the kechyn for to haſte the meate, for the kinge Yon wolde eate, to the whyche men made good cheere, bycauſe they knew not the treaſon that he had doone. Whan the clerke ſawe Mawgys: he called hym, and ſayd to hym. Ha Mawgys how it is yl with you? for if god put no remedy in you ye haue loſte that

Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mawgis vnderſtoode thys: he was ſorye for it that he fell downe in a ſwoune to therth, and at the fallyng that he made he brake all hys browes. And whan he was com agayne to himſelfe, he was ſo ſory y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wyſt not what he ſhould doo.

Ha gentyll knyght haue mercye vpon you, kyll not your ſelfe, for your ſoule ſhalbe da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for it, but light a horſbacke and take wyth you all the men of armes that ben within and the good horſe bayarde that renneth ſo faſt, and goe there as your coſyns ben gone as ſoone as ye may.

Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darde ſayd Mawgys your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel is right good, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he began to weep and ſaid. Ha noble knight Reynawd it is great dommage yf ye be dead, but I make my vowe to God that if ye and your brethern be dead: I ſhall neuer liue two dayes after you. And than Mawgys without any noyſe or onye worde to be made of this to kyng Yon nor to his ſyſter the wife of Reynawde: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde all the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours of the caſtell to be redy in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes lightly, and whan the knightes vnderſtode hym: they tooke theyr har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neys on in contynent as they were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to doo.

            <p>THen whan the Knightes of Reynawde vnderſtode thys: they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make ſuche ſorow that it was pity for to ſee, &amp; wiſſhed after the noble knightes that were gone to theyr death, &amp; were ſore deſperat that they wolde almoſt haue killed them ſelfe.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded me whan he went that I ſhould not ſuffre no body to lyght v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it till he were come agayne, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mawgys vnderſtode the anſwere of the palfraynyer: he was wroth, and ſmote hym wyth hys fyſte ſo greate a ſtroke that he caſt him at his foote afore hym and after went hymſelfe to the ſtable where Bayarde was. Whan Bayarde ſaw Mawgis: he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan to ſhrinke hys eares and ſmote with his forfeete ſo ſtronge that no body durſt go nighe him, but the pal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fraynyer that tended vpon him, and whan Mawgys ſaw that Bayarde plaied ſo he tooke a ſtaffe and ſmote bayarde vpon the head ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him kneele to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erth. And whan bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde ſawe he was ſo curſtly dealed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all: he was aferde leaſt he ſhould be yet more ſhrewdely handled and ſo he helde hymſelfe ſtyll, &amp; Mawgys caſte the ſadle vpon hym and bridled hym. And wyt it that whan Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys was vpon bayardes backe: he was wel lyke a valyaunt man and a hardy knyght, for he was one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayreſt knightes of the worlde and one of the beſt, and the moſte ſubtyll of the worlde. And whan Mawgys and al his folke were al redy a horſe backe well armed: they went out at the gate fawcon. And they myght well be aboute fyue thouſande men well horſed and well armed, and .vii hondred good archers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer wold go backe for no doubte of death by any maner, and they ſet themſelfe to the way, not by the ryght waye: but wente throughe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood al a couerte wyth great diligence, and alwayes Mawgys went wiſſhyng after rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and after hys bretherne, for he wyſte not yf they were dead or a lyue, and ſayd to hymſelfe. Ha Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde God be thys day wyth you, &amp; keep you &amp; your bretherne fro death and fro pryſon. But now yf the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Al thus as Reynawde dyd reſte himſelfe vpon the defence of the roche and thought in hymſelfe what he myght doo: he turned his ſight towarde the wood and ſaw come Mawgis w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his folke the ſheelde at the necke the ſwerde in the hande and mounted vpon Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde, wyt it that bayarde wente not the lytle paſe but wente lyke a ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, for at euerye lepe that he made he lept thirty foote of grounde. And whan Reynawde ſawe Mawgys come with ſo great folke &amp; ſo fayre a company: all his body ſheuered all ſodeynlye for great ioye, and forgat all the great ſorowe &amp; torment that he had ſuffred all the daye and ſayde to his brethern.

And than Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd tooke him betwene his armes and ſhewed him Mawgis that came rydynge vpon Bayarde as faſte as tempeſt, whan Richarde ſawe maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys: he was ſo gladde that he fell in a ſwoune betwene his brothers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. And whan he was come againe to himſelf: he ſaid. Now am I whole for I fele nother yll nother ſore, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reinawd ſaid Alard, what ſhall we doo? for if the frenſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceiue the comming of Mawgis: they ſhal flee, and I wolde for no good that they ſhould doo ſo, for I wolde that we were firſte auenged vpon theym for the great hurt that thei haue doon to vs, but let vs doo one thyng that I ſhall tel you. Let vs goe downe to the foote of the roche and begyne the battayle, &amp; while that they ſhal fight with vs: Mawgis ſhal be come, and by all thus they ſhall not ſcape vs, brother ſaid Reinawde ye ſay well and we ſhal doo ſo, &amp; than Reinawd, Alard and Guicharde wente downe to the foote of the roche, and the litell Rycharde bod aboue vpon the roche for he coulde not moue nother helpe himſelfe.</p>
            <p>REinawde came downe from the roche with his two breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, And whan the frenſhemen ſawe them: they began to ſaie thone to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>THis hanging: that Reinawd ſpake to Ogyer: Ogier be helde towarde the ryghte waye that came to the wood &amp; ſawe folke come to Reinawd that Maugis brought, and was all afore mounted vpon Bayard that came faſt.

Ogier I holde you for a foole bycauſe that ye came heere to werke treaſon. I chalenge of you Reinawd and his brethren, and am come heere to be theyr ſuretie. By god Ogier it longeth not to you for to betray thus Reynawd &amp; his bretherne, for ye be of his lignage but ye haue yl ſhewed it to him, your father wrought neuer treaſon, &amp; I meruayll me ſore howe ye wold graunt to it, your father left you in Fraunce for a pledge at ſaynt Omers to Charlemain, whoſe man ye are, paying to him euery yere foure peny weyght of golde.

            <p>THenne were the frenſhemen ſore abaſhed whan thei heard Reynawde repreue Ogier ſo, wherof they were gladde and ſaide togither wel finde ye now the reward of your goodnes, if ye wold haue doone your deuoure: the foure ſonnes of Aymon had be taken. And whan Ogyer ſaw himſelf thus repreued of the one part and of the other: he was ryghte ſory for it. And than they lefte him vpon the ryuer ſyde of Dordon, and abode wyth hym but .x. menne. And whan Ogier ſawe that all his companye had lefte hym: he knewe wel that they dyd ſo for diſpite, than ſayde he all by hymſelfe. Fayre God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am wel worthy to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thus. And the prouerbe maye-well be reherſed for a trouthe, that ſayth.

O mad beſte ye blame me wrongefully and without a cauſe, for ye and your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſhould haue be hanged by this without any pardonne, nor Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys hadde neuer come heere tyme y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe, wherof ye haue called me traytoure, but ye lye falſlye.

And than he broched brayforde wyth the ſpurres and put hymſelfe to ſwyme ouer the ryuer. And whan he was come to the playne grounde: he made hym ready for to iouſte as were as he was. And whan Reynawd ſaw O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier ſo yll arayed for to fyght: he had pyte therof, and ſayde to hym. Coſin I haue at this houre no wyll for to

For Foulques and the earle Guimard ſhould complain in helle vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, and of the other part I ſhoulde haue none excuſe towarde the king Charlemain if I went thus awaye, for ye haue well ſlaine foure hundred knightes of ours, wherfore I ſay cor a concluſion that I ſhal not goe my waye, but that I medle firſt with you, for ye wot well that yf I went thus my way: the king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine ſhould beare me ſome diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure for it, and he ſhoulde haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone &amp; alſo he ſhoulde make me to be headed, and therfore I wil fyght with you, for certes I haue leuer die than to returne thus to him, and yf God hathe ordeined that ye ſhall ſmite of my heade: I pardone you my death. for if I canne ouercome you: I ſhall bringe you to the king Charlemaine what ſomeuer come of it.</p>

Sir ſaide Ogier all fayre and foftlye, wit it that they been no children: but they are the beſt knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the world, and they be alyue. I tell you ſir that we founde them in the plaine of Valcolours, all foure clothed in ſcarlet furred with ermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vpon mules, and bare in their handes floures, and roſes, wel hath the king of Gaſcoygne kepte his couenaunt to you, for he hath ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

            <p>HA ſaid themperaur Charlemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne is it true that they been ſo ſcaped? ſir ſaid Ogier, yea vere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, whan the king vnderſtoode that Reinawd and his brethern were ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: he was right wroth &amp; ful angry for it and ſaid.

Mawgis ſhould delyuer theym oute, and therfore I hate him to death, wherof I pray out lorde that I die not till I be fyrſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of it, ſyr ſaide Ogier by the faith that I owe to you. Reinawde gaue me ſo greate a ſtroke that the corner of my helme fel downe wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the earthe, and I promyſe you I was wel glad wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was eſcaped from his handes, for of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand that we brought with vs: there are come againe but three hundred, &amp; the ſurples is all ſlaine other taken. Whan Rowland vnderſtoode theyſe wordes: he ſhooke al for angre &amp; ſaid by great wrathe.

For by ſainte Denis of Fraunce, I ſhall defende me ayenſt you with my ſwerde, and ſo ſhall I ſhewe to you yf I be true or no.

Beware ye be not ſo hardy for to ſet hande vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on me, for by the faythe that I ow to hym that, begate me I ſhall make thy heade to flee fro thy bodye, yf ye come anye nerer.

But we merueile howe Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſuffreth you to take ſo greate a pryde vpon you, and if he ſuffereth it: we will not doo ſo for no thynge that can come of it. Whan Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſawe this great noyſe betwen hys barons: he was righte wrothe &amp; ſayde to Rowland.

            <p>NOw ſheweth the hiſtory that after Reinawde had diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyted the frenſhemen: he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain toward roche Montbron where he had left his brother Richard thus wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as ye haue heard.

And after he had ſayde that worde: he fel to the grounde from Bayarde in a ſwoun. And whan Alarde, and Guicharde, ſawe theyr brother that was falle: they beganne to make theyr mone of Richarde pitteouſly. And whan Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde was come agayne to himſelf: he made great ſorowe with hys two brethren Alarde, and Guichard, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Richarde their brother that laye vpon the earthe with his bowelles betwene his handes. And this han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng: came Mawgis vpon broykar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re his good horſe the beſt that menne wyſte after bayarde, and held a peece of a ſpere in his hande. And whan he ſawe Reinawde make ſuche a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe: he was right ſorye for it. And whan he ſawe Richarde thus ſore wounded: he was wrothe and hadde great pytie for to ſee the wound that was ſo greate, for men ſaw the liuer within his body. Thenne ſayd he to

I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſocoured you manye tymes, and wit it that all the harme that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine bereth to me, it is al through your occaſion, he ſlew my father but late, wherof I beare yet at my hert greate heauynes, that was your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that died for your loue that know ye well. But yf ye wyll promiſe me afore all youre barons for to come wyth me into the tente of the kynge Charlemayne and helpe me to ſawe hym for to auenge vpon hym the death of my ſaide father yf we can: I ſhall deliuer to you Richarde euyn now whole and ſound wythout any ſore. And whan Reynawde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode theſe wordes: he came vnto Mawgis, &amp; kiſſed him in the breſt all weeping and ſaid to hym. Righte ſweet and fayre coſyn for god mercy Delyuer to me ayen my brother Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard whole yf it pleaſe you. And yf ye will that I doo any thyng for you: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund me, and I ſhal doo it with right good hert. For ye wot wel that I dyd neuer any thyng that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſt your wyll, nor there is no man in the worlde, for whome I wolde, doo ſo much as I wolde doo for you. whan Mawgys ſawe Reynawde weep ſo tenderly: he had greate pitie of it and ſayde to him. Nowe be not dyſmayed of no thyng fayre coſyne, for ye ſhall haue Rycharde whole and ſounde incontynente. And than lyghted downe from his horſe, and toke a bottell with white wine and waſhed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wounde of Richarde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ryghte well, and had away all the bloode that was about. And be not meruaylled where he gatte all ſuche thynges as apperteyned vnto this cute: For he was the ſubtelleſte nygromancyer that euer was in the worlde. And whan he had doone ſoo: he toke his bowelles and put theym agayne in to his bodye, and than he toke a nedell and a threde, and ſewed vp the wounde full mayſterly &amp; hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not Rycharde, and after he tooke a ſalue. Whereof he anoynted all the wounde, and as ſoone as the wound was thus anoynted: it was as whol as thoughe he had neuer be hurte in that place of his body. And whan he had doone al this: he tooke a drinke &amp; gaue it to Richarde for to drynke. &amp; whan Richard had dronken it he ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe lyghtly vpon his feete al deliuered and quyte fro his diſeaſe, and ſayde to his bretherne, where is Ogier go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and his folke, are they ſcaped fro vs? brother anſwered Reynawde we haue dyſcomfyted theym, God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercye and Mawgis that came for to ſuccoure vs, for otherwyſe we ſhould haue ben al dead, &amp; ſo he hath ſaued vs and our lyues at thys tyme now ought we well to loue him more than our ſelfe, brother ſayde Rychar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ye ſaye trouth, and after Alarde ſayde to Mawgys, fayre coſyn heale me I pray you, for I haue a greate wounde in the thie. And I alſo ſayd Reynawde for I am hurte right ſore, and I alſo ſayde Guychard, for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des loue gyue vs health vnto al vs, than ſayde Mawgys vnto theym,

Than tooke Mawgis of the white wyne, wherof he had waſhed the wounde of Richard, and waſhed their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of them all and after anoynted them ſweetly and anon they were all whole. And whan they were al gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed: they made Richarde to light vpon a horſe, and put them ſelf to the way for to returne againe to Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban. And thus thei went on their waye: a ſpye departed fro the felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Reinawd and came to Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>ANd whan the king yon vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode theſe tidinges: he was ſore abaſhed of it that he wyſt not what he ſhould ſaye, and after he ſaid. Alas how goeth this? here ben euil tydynges, how may this be? dyd they fynde the buſſhemente of the kynge Charlemayne? Syr ſayde the ſpie, yea certaynly and ſhoulde haue been curſedly handled if their coſyne Mawgys had not ſocoured them, &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſocours that Maugis brought with him: Ogier was diſcomfited &amp; all his folke of Charlemaine, ſo that fewe of them ſcaped. For Mawgys brought to Reinawde Bayarde hys good horſe, that was cauſe of all the harme that was doon there of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte. Alas vnhappy myſchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaid than the king yon and what ſhal I doo? if I abide Reinawd, Mawgis Alard, Guycharde and Richarde: I am deade without doubte, for all the worlde canne not defende me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fro. And alſo it were well ryght, nor Reynawde ſhould doo but well yf he ſlewe me cruelly. For I haue wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued death, for neuer Iudas ne the Emperour Neron of Rome made ſo great a treaſon as I haue doone that wolde haue brought to a cruel death the beſt knightes of the worlde, that been the foure ſonnes of Aimon for the thretning of a prince. And whan he had ſaid theſe wordes: he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to make great ſorowe, and ſaide. Ha fayre ſiſter Clare, this daye ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte our loue, ye ſhall neuer ſeme more.

Now go hence faire lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des for goddes ſake, be lyghtly ready For the need of it is nowe come, and lette vs goe bringe with vs the beſt knyghtes that I &amp; ye haue and if we may doo ſo much to get the woode of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whiche is a great foreſt: we ſhal be ſafe ynough, &amp; we ſhal maye ſcape at our eaſe. For we ſhall lodge our ſelf within an abbay of ſaint La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zare, and we ſhal take ſuch habyte as the monkes there haue. And by all thus ſhal we may be ſaued. For I know ſo much goodnes in Reinawd that whan he ſhall fynde vs ſhorne as Monkes: he ſhall doo vs no

And anon he tanne as faſt as he might to Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tbendell and went into the pauilion of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne and called Rowlande and ſayde to hym. Syr I ſhall tell you ſuche tydynges, wherby ye ſhall get good ynoughe, yf ye wyll beleue me, and I ſhall tell you a thyng wherof ye ſhalbe ryght glad. Good freende ſayde than Rowlande, thou art wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com to me, &amp; what tidinges bringeſt thou tel me I praye thee? Syr ſayde Pygwade, wyt it that the kyng Yon fleeth away all vnarmed, he and all hys folke and hath wyth theym no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Somer nor Mule, but onlye theyr beſt horſes, and they go into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood of the ſerpent into a houſe of religion, whiche is named ſaint La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zare, &amp; he himſelfe is delibered for to take the habite and to be come a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>For I neuer loued traytours nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall and God wyll. Syr ſayde pigwade yet is there more, for I haue found Reynawde, his brethern and Mawgys that came ouer the ryuer of balancon, that bringeth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many pryſoners of your folke. And yf ye wyll fynde theym: ye muſte go that waye. Freende ſayd Rowlande ye haue deſerued a great reward, for ye haue brought to vs good tydyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Than Rowlande called to hym Olyuer, and ſayd. Olyuer my good &amp; true felaw, lyght vpon your horſe quickely, and bryng wyth you Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellon and Richarde of Normandy &amp; ye ſyr Ogyer of Denmarke ye ſhall come with me, if it pleaſe you, and ye ſhall ſee the great proweſſe of Rey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde the ſonne of Aymon, and we ſhal take with vs but foure thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men, and yet Reynawde is fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand well horſed and well arayed.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſhal mowe fyght with them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any auauntage. Certes ſayde Ogyer I ſhall goe there to ſee how ye ſhall haue hym. And whan ye haue taken hym: I promyſe you to lend you a rope yf ye haue need of it. And whan they had al deuiſed thei mounted on horſebacke, and tooke theyr waye. And the greate ribawde guided them ſtreight to the riuer of Balancon, and the king of Gaſcoin rode than through the woodes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſerpent wyth his folke, and he rode ſo longe that he ariued at the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of ſaint Lazare. And they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the abbot of the place ſo muche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made them monkes in the deuils name. This hangynge: came there

But wyt that we ſeeke heere the falſeſt traytour of the worlde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men call the kynge Yon of Gaſcoyn the whych is heere within, for I wil hange hym lyke a theefe.</p>
            <p>THan anſwered the abbot, ye ſhall not ſyr and pleaſe you, for he is become our monke, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he hath taken the habite, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſhall defende hym agaynſt all men. Whan Rowlande heard the abbot ſpeake ſo: he tooke hym by the hood.

Now mayſter monke delyuer to me lyghtly that deuyl the king yon whyche is the brother of Iudas, or els I ſhall make an ende of you, for I haue ſworne that he ſhal neuer doo treaſon more. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the abbot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode this that Rowlande ſayde to him: he and all his monkes fled awai from him. And whan Rowland ſaw this: he ſet hande at his good ſwerde Durandall, and entred into the cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, where he founde the kynge Yon kneeling before an Image of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and was clad with the habite of religion, and the hode vpon his head And whan Rowlande ſawe hym: he knew him well. For he had ſeen him with his vncle Charlemayne. Than he tooke him and ſayde to hym, ſyr monke in the Deuils name conne ye well your leſſon, aryſe vp with ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we and come with me for to ſee the kyng Charlemayne. For he ſhal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke you to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged as a traytour pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued euill king and a felon.

And than gaue him the mokes hode vpon his head. And thus ſat in the ſadle the face towarde the horſe tayle, and the backe forwarde. The king yon made none other thinge but that he wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſtyll after Reynawde and hys brethern and ſayd. Alas and that I dyd great harme, whan that I conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this mortall treaſon, nowe ought I well to dye ten tymes yf it might be ſo. For I haue wel deſerued death. Whan the king yon had ſayde this: he ſayd to one of his priuy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And yf he can recouer me: I wyll that he make my tonge to be cut of wherby I dyd conſent to the treaſon, or elles my heade, yf it ſemeth him good for I haue well deſerued it ayenſt hym. Syr ſayde the knyght I ſhall not goe there, for I wot well that Reinawd wyll not ſet one foot out to ſaue you, bycauſe of the greate harme that ye wolde haue doon to hym, he ſhal ſayd the kynge yon, for I knowe ſo much by hym that he ſhall not ſaie there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſt.

Wherfore we praye you that ye wyll pardon her.</p>
            <p>Than ſayd Reynawde, my brethern for the loue of you I graunt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame and I pardon her myne euill wyll preſently. Whan the brethern vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtode him: they were ryght glad, and came to the Lady Clare, and ſayd to her. Madame be of good cheere and make ioye, for we haue made youre peace. And than Alarde and Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde tooke her by the handes, and brought her to her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Reynawd &amp; whan Reynawde ſaw her: he went and tooke her by the chyn and kiſſed her. And than began the ioy and the feaſt ryght great at Mountawban. And they waſſhed their handes and went to theyr meate. And thus as they ſat at the table: there came in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meſſanger of the king Yon, that cam to Reynawde, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was afore Reynawde: he ſayd to hym. Syr the kyng Yon ſendeth you worde by me that ye com to ſuccour him, for other wyſe he cannot ſcape the death. For Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and Olyuer ledeth him for to be hanged at Mountfawcon, and doo thys ſyr yf it pleaſe you for god and beholde not his euyll wyl, but take heed to your goodnes, for oure
<pb facs="tcp:7017:88"/> Lorde pardonned Mary Magdalen and longis of their ſinnes. He kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath deſerued death for the great faute that he hath doon to you, and yf ye ſlea him: he pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to you his death.</p>
            <p>GOddes curſe haue he ſayd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larde that ſhall ſet hys foote thitherwarde, nor that ſhal bye him agayne though he might be had for a ſtrawe, but goddes curſe haue Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land yf he ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth him not as a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour approued. wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde had heard this that the meſſanger ſayd: he looked downwarde and ſtudied a good whyle that he ſayd no worde, &amp; whan he had thought long ynough: he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to weepe beholding his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, for a good herte can not lye wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it cometh to a need. Than ſayd he a good reaſon as a noble knight. Lordes ſayd Reynawde to hys bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern &amp; to his knightes, Now heare what I wyll ſay to you. Ye knowe how I was diſherited at paris wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gefully vpon a feaſt of Penthecoſte that Charlemaine helde open court and full in hys palays, where was a compani of great lordes. For there were .vii. hundred knyghtes all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen bothe of name and of armes and a hondred what of Dukes and of Erles, and more than foure ſcore byſſhopes, and many barons, &amp; that tyme was ſlayne the duke Benes of Aygremount myne vncle that was ſo good a knyght as men knew wel. I dyd aſke right for him to Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne afore all hys courte: wherof the kynge rebuked me and called me all to nought, and greate iniurye he ſayd to me. And whan I ſawe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng repreued me thus: I was wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the and right angry for it, &amp; I beheld vpon my brethern and knewe theyr ſtomackes, and ſaw myne enemyes before me, ſo neded not that I ſhould haue ſought them els where. And it ſuffiſed theym not of that I had be outraged by Charlemayne: but that Berthelot outraged me of newe, he and I playinge at the Cheſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cheſſe boorde and ſmote hym with it ſo greate a ſtroke vpon hys head that I ſlew hym afore my feet. And Lewes a nother neuew of Charlemayne wolde haue ſlayne my brother Richarde and had hurte hym all redy full ſore. But I ſmote hym in ſuche wiſe with my fyſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I feld him downe dead afore me to therth, &amp; whan Charlemayne wyſt of it: he wolde haue made me to be killed &amp; hewed into peeces, but my kynſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wolde not ſuffre it, for there was great medlyng ſo that many ſtrokes were gyuen. And whan the medling was ended: I mounted vpon Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde &amp; my brethern I made to mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo thone before &amp; the two other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde me, and thus rode we al foure vpon my horſe bayarde, &amp; ſo came to Ardeyne, where I dyd buylde a caſtell. And there Chaylemane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and beſeeged me, and made ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re mi good father Aimon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de neuer helpe vs wyth none of all his goods, and that he ſhould be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ayenſte vs and in lyke wiſe he for cloſed me fro all my kynſmen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none of them was not ſo hardy for to haue ſhewed to vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt fauour
<pb n="lxxxiii" facs="tcp:7017:88"/> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde. Fayre bretherne ye kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we wel the great pouertie that we ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue endured ſo longe time. And whan I ſawe that I wyſt not where to go I came into thys lande wyth ſuche a felawſhip as ye knowe, &amp; I ſpake to the kynge Yon and ſhewed hym howe I had warre agaynſt Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and he ſhewed me great loue and made me great honour ſo that he gaue me his ſyſter to my wyfe, and with her a duchy, &amp; builded Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for me. And of the other parte my chyldren are hys neuews, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thone beareth his name, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and ye ſee them here, and I haue ſaued hym hys Realme and all hys londe, and all his rebelles I haue made come to ſeeke mercy of hym, &amp; I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him neuer in faute, but Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne is ſo great and ſo myghty a kynge, and alſo ye knowe well that he hath ouercome and dyſſhonoured many good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for fere of him: the kyng Yon betrayed vs, wherof he is not to be blamed ouermuche, ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynge that agaynſt Charlemayne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge hath power. And therfore yf the kynge Yon deliuered me to char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne: it was by euyll counſell y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome of hys barons gaue hym. For god made neuer ſo good a man, but that, that he miſdoeth by euyll coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell ſomtyme. And how can I leaue hym whan I haue not myſtruſted hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afore time? me ſemeth that I ought to ſhew hym goodnes agaynſt felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye. Therfore I pray you all that ye wyll make you redy, for I wyll goe ſuccour him. For it were great repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che to my chyldren that theyr vncle ſhould be hanged as a theefe, and it were to vs a great diſſhonour, for he is our lord, and if he had doone euil: we ought to doo well agaynſt it, and alſo we ought not to forget the bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faytes that the kynge yon hath doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to vs, and I promiſe you that the faute and the treaſon that he hath doone is not come through his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce, but through euyll counſel. For yf it had be onlye by hys mocyon: I wolde ſee the hert from the bodye of hym, but I wot wel nay, for Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne is of ſo great power that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man feareth him. And therfore I tell you that I wil goe reſcue him from Rowlande if I can wyth all my power. By my fayth ſayd Alard ye ſhall than goe wythout me, for I ſhal not put my feet there, for a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ought neuer to be holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>coured.

And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde ſware it vnto him vpon his parte of paradyſe. Reynawde ſayde Rowlande I wyl goe take leue of my felaw Oliuer, for I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him that al the batayles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhall vndertake: he ſhal mow make them himſelfe if it pleaſe him.

Sir Rowlande what ſaith Reynawde, haue ye ſpoke with him? yea ſayd Rowlande, and what thinke you bi him. Certes ſaid Rowland, Reynawde is a ſage kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght &amp; well taught, for he hath requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to fyght with him bodye to bodye, and that our folke be ſtyll of the one ſyde and of the other. Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſayd Oliuer, ye ſhal doo in this your pleaſure, for other yee or I muſt fight with him, but I counſell
<pb facs="tcp:7017:91"/> that ye goe there, for as longe as I ſhall lyue I ſhal not be enemy to Rey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde only for his worthynes. For Reynawde is a knight of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Whan the byſſhop Turpyn. Hector the ſonne of Oedon and the other Erles hearde this: they began to ſay, Rowland what is that ye wil doo? For gods mercy doo it not, for Reynawde is of your lynage and of ours, and if ye bringe him to death: we ſhal neuer loue you after. Syr le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that offre that Reynawde giueth to you and make your folke to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble with the folke of Reynawde, for it is better that they be take of youre folke, than that the one of you two were dead: wyll ye that it be ſo ſayde Rowland? yea ſyr yf it pleaſe you.</p>
            <p>Certes ſaid Rowland it pleaſeth me ryght well and than he ſayd to al his folke, Lordes thinke to defende you well, for it is now need therof. Syr ſayd the other haue no doubte of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, for we ſhall doo wel your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And Rowlande began to crye mount ioye ſaynt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys, and whan came to ſettinge on with ſperes: ye ſhould haue ſeen tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many a knight brought to grounde &amp; manye horſe that ranne mayſterles thorough the feeldes ſo much that it was great pitie for to ſee ſo greate a deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of knightes as was made there. Whan Reynawde ſaw the two hoſtes muſte aſſemble together: he ſpurred Bayarde with the ſpurres &amp; put himſelf amonge the thickeſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frenche men, and ſmote a knight ſo harde in the breſte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ouerthrewe bothe horſe and man to the grounde. and after ſmote another ſo ſore that nether for ſheelde nor for quyras of ſteele he let not but that he ſhoued the yren of his ſpere thorough and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe his bodi, and fell dead to the erth, and wit at that ſtroke he brake his ſpere and Reynawde ſet hande lightly to his ſwerde, and began to crye Mountawban as lowde as he coulde. And than he made ſo greate ſlaughter of Frenchemen: that none durſt abide afore hym, but fled from him as fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death. Shortli to ſpeake Reynawd did ſo much thorough his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, &amp; thorough the highe knight hode of his brethern: that he brake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſte batayle of the Frenche men, wolde they or no.</p>

            <p>WHan the litell Richarde, the brother of Reynawde ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the frenſhemen were put a backe: He beganne to crie on heighte Ardeyne, as muche as he mighte, and put him ſelfe in to the greateſt preſe amonge hys enemies, and beganne to make ſo great hewing of folke that it was wunderfull to ſee. For Reinawde fought not, for to loke the better vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And thenne Rycharde that thought hym ſelfe neuer wery of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng of ſtrokes: began to calle vpon his brother, and ſaide.

Alas ſmite now vpon them, for they been almoſt ouercome, make that the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemen full of pride mocke not with you, and ſo make we ſuche a thinge that it be ſpoken of it vnto Parys. Whan Reynawde hearde Rycharde ſpeake thus: he beganne to ſmile, and after he ſmote bayard with the ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res &amp; began to ſmite better thenne he byd afore.

And whan the frenſſhmen ſaw that the diſcomfiture tourned vpon them: they began to call Rowlande, and ſayd to him. Ha Rowland what doo ye? Why come ye not and helpe youre folke?

               </gap>, but dyd lyke a curteous knighte, and he dyd as the barons had ſente him worde. For he tooke a ſpere and ranne vpon Reinawde as much as he myght. And whan Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naude ſawe he wold none otherwiſe doo: he ranne alſo with a ſpere vpon Rowlande, and rought eche other ſo wonderful hard that they made theyr ſperes to flee all in peeces, and whan they had broken their ſperes: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred eche other with theyr ſheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſo ſtronglye that both theyr hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that is to wit Bayard and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes ſtakered, and were all aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therwithal. But with that ſtroke Rowland and Melantes were both felled to the grounde on a heape, and Reinawd paſſed forth by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cryinge with an high voyce Mountawban. Wherby I tell you for certayne that Rowlande neuer felle downe for no ſtroke of ſpere: but onely that tyme. but it was no meruaile. For he could not holde hym ſelfe by the cloudes whan his horſe had failled hym.</p>
            <p>THan whan Rowlande ſawe hymſelfe thus ouerthrowen: he was not wel contente and roſe in continente and toke his ſwerd in hys hand, and came to Melantes for to cutte of his head, and began to ſay euyll courſer who keepeth me that I kille the not? not ſith that thou haſt let falle thy ſelfe throughe the ſtroke of a childe, I ſhall neuer truſt thee. So helpe me god Rowlande ſayde Reynawd ye doo to Melantes great wronge. For it is longe ſith that he eat any meat, and therfore he can not trauayll lyke bayarde for he is more

And whan Reinawde ſawe that: he ſayd to Rowland. What wyl ye doo? it is no worſhyppe to you to ſmyte a beaſt, and yf ye wyl doo any fayte of armes: come to me &amp; not to my horſe for I ſhall gyue you ſtrokes ynou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe ſo muche that ye ſhall be wery of it or we departe, but keep wel that I ſlea not you &amp; leue Bayard in peace.

Reynawde Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſayd Rowlande, threten not ſo much. For before thys day be com at an ende: ye ſhall ſee a thynge that ſhall not pleaſe you ouer much.</p>
            <p>REynawde was not contente whan he vnderſtoode the ylle wordes of Rowlande, and ſhooke al for angre, and incontinent ranne vp on Rowlande and gaue him ſuche a ſtroke vpon his helme: that he all to bruſed it, and the ſtroke ſlided vpon the ſheelde ſo that he cut of it a great quarter, and of the courſet of ſteele al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, but he cut nothinge of the fleſhe. And whan Reynawde hadde gyuen Rowlande that ſtroke: he ſayde in maner of a mocke to Rowlande, what ſaye ye by my ſwerde, doo it cut well or no? for I haue not miſſed at that ſtroke, now keep you well fro me, for I am not ſuche a childe as ye take me for. Whan Rowlande felte that great ſtroke that Reinawde had gyuen to hym: he was all meruayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of it, and withdrewe hymſelfe a backe for he wold not that Reynawd ſhould haue recouered a nother ſtroke vpon hym ſodenly, and ſette hande to Durandall his good ſwerde and ranne vpon Reinawde, and Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd helde his ſheelde ayenſt it. and Rowlande ſmot in to the ſheelde ſo great a ſtroke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he cloue it by the mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des through and through, &amp; the ſtroke deſcended vpon the helme and dyd it no harme. And whan Rowland had made that ſtroke: he ſaid to Reinawd Vaſſail ye be now quite. for I haue yelded you againe that ye lended me ryghte nowe. Nowe ſhall I ſee who ſhall begynne agayne. By my ſoule ſayd Reinawde fowle fall haue I now yf I feyne me nowe. For I dyd but playe afore, nor your fraunchyſe ſhal neuer auaylle you ayenſt me but that I ſhall brynge youre pryde all downe to the erthe. Reynawde ſaid Rowland yf ye doo this that ye ſay: ye ſhall werke merueilles. And all thus as they wold haue begon again the bataylle: ſo came there Mawgis &amp; al his company, &amp; ſaid to Reinawd Coſyn mounte vpon bayarde, for it were to great a loſſe yf you or Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande
<pb facs="tcp:7017:93"/> were deade, &amp; there came Ogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; Olyuer and made Rowland to light agayne vpon his horſe. But wit it well that Ogyer had not be ſo gladde yf one had giue to him a great cytie: as he was be cauſe that Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde had caſt downe Rowland &amp; his horſe. And whan they had recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Rowland: they began a ſore ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle and a cruell, and ſo fell that it was pytie for to ſee, for the one hewe the other without anye mercye. And whan Rowland ſawe that the batail was begon, again his hert dyd ſwell for angre by cauſe that Reinawde bad ouerthrowen him to the ground, ſo beganne he to cal as hyghe as he myght. Where are ye gone Reynaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the ſonne of Aymon, goe a ſide and lette vs parfornyſhe our batayl for men knowe not yet whiche is the beſt knyghte of vs two.

And whan the other ſawe Reynawd amonge them: they put themſelfe to flyght, and ſaid the one to the other.

And than they put themſelfe into the thyckeſt of the foreſt, and lefte behynde theym the kynge yon that they lodged as a pryſoner. And Reynawd came ſtreyght to hym and vnbounde hym and vnſtopped hys eyen, and after ſayde to hym

And whan that the frenſhemen ſaw that Rowland wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de haue taken Richard: they ſette al, vpon him, ſo that they ſmote hym wyth more then foure ſwerdes al at once, and it happed ſo that his horſe was kylled vnder hym, and he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen to the erthe. And whan that Richard ſaw his horſe dead a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: he was ryght ſory for it, and roſe vp quickelye vpon his feete, and ſmote the erle Anthony ſo greate a ſtroke with his ſwerd that he wounded him ryght ſore. Humall the breton ſawe that: &amp; he ſmot Richard, and Richard recouered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him with ſuch a ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke that he felled both horſe and man to the erthe. And with this: Guidello<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came from behynde and ouerthrewe Richarde fro the arſons of hys ſadle to the grounde. And whan Rowland ſaw Richard at the ground: he came to hym and ſayde. Nowe yeeld you and abyde not that we ſlea you, for it were great domage, ſyr ſayd than Richard the yongeſt ſonne of Aimon to you Rowlande I ſhall yeeld me &amp; to none other. For I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not yeeld me to no better man than ye be one. And with this he tooke him his ſwerde, &amp; Rowlande receyued it with a good wyll and made the lytell Rycharde to light vpon a mule. And thus they hadde hym pryſoner. Alas and what a domage ſhall it be yf the prue Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde be hanged? he is well lyke to be, but that god &amp; Mawgys delyuer hym, all this myſhappe ſawe a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte of Richarde. And whan he ſaw that men ledde thus his maiſter Richard: he ſpurred hys horſe with the ſpurres and auentured him ſelfe to paſſe ouer the riuer, and came ligh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>telye to Reinawde and ſaide to hym. Syr I bringe you euell tydynges wyt that Rowlande leadeth wyth hym your brother Rycharde for pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner well ſhamefully. Whan Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde vnderſtoode theſe wordes: he was ſore angry for it, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte loſt his wytte, and after he
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:7017:94"/> ſayde to the yemon, come hither tell me my freend, are they that leden my brother terre hence? Syr ſayd the ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yea, it is not poſſyble that ye ſhoulde ouertake theim. And whan Reynawde vnderſtood this: he was more angry than he was tofore, and fell from bayarde in a ſwoune to the erthe. And whan he was come again to him ſelfe: he behelde afore hym. And ſawe his broher Alarde come with his folke that came after Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde by the traſe. For they wende that Richarde hadde be gone to hym longe afore them. And whan Alarde ſawe Reynawd make ſuch a ſorow: he came than to hym and ſayde in thys maner. Ha fayre brother, and what eyleth you? It longeth nor to ſuch a knight as ye be for to make ſo great a ſorow as ye doo. Alard ſayd Reinawd, ye haue doone ful yl, for I haue left my brother Richarde with you to keep hym, and ye haue loſt him, for Rowland ledeth him with hym as priſoner, and he is all ready ſo ferre brought that we can nor ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour hym, whan Alard, &amp; Guichard vnderſtoode theſe tydynges: they beganne to make ſuche a ſorow that it was meruaile for to ſee the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion that thei made, alas ſayd Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, what is he that hath parted our company? to day in the morning we were foure bretherne togyther &amp; nowe we been but three. Ha fayre brother Richard it is greate domage of you, for if ye had liued your age: ye ſhould haue paſſed all your brethern ſeyng that ye were the yongeſt of vs all and yet ye were the moſt hardye, and throughe your hardynes: ye are taken, fayre brother ſayd Alarde, all cometh by you that brought vs heere ayenſt our wyl for to ſuccour the ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g yon. Now haue we loſte Rycharde, wherof the loſſe ſhall neuer be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, for we ſhall neuer ſee hym a lyue. And whan he had ſayd thys: he ſayd to Guycharde. Brother drawe out your ſwerde ſo ſhall we cut of the head of thys traytoure kinge yon therwith, for whome we haue nowe loſt our brother Richarde, brother ſaide than Reynawde.

And I ſhall abyde heere wyth my good horſe Bayarde and flamberge my good ſwerde wythout any other company. So ſhall I goe in to the pauylion of Charlemayne, where I ſhal recouer my brother Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard or a nother pryſoner for hym: or elles I ſhall die with him. And whan he had ſaid that word: he ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bayarde with the ſpurres for to haue gone thyther: but Alarde tooke him by the brydell and Guycharde tooke him with both his armes fro behind for to keep him that he ſhould not goe, and than Alard ſaid to him, by ſaynt Peter of rome ye ſhall not goe no foot there, for it is better that Rycharde: dye yf it muſt be ſothan ye ſhould dye. And thus as the three bretherne made theyr mone for Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde, came there Mawgys theyr coſin y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> folowed them, &amp; when he ſaw his coſins make ſuch ſorow: he was ſore a gaſt and ſaid to them.

            <p>NOw telleth the hiſtorye, that whan Mawgys was come againe to Mountawban: he was ſo much wrothe that he myght no more for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of Richard that was take. And becauſe that Reinawde and his bretherne made therfore ſo great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe. Incontinente that he was lyghted from hys horſe, he went in to his chambre and made hym ſelfe to be diſarmed and after he tooke of all his clothes, and put him ſelfe all naked, and this doone: he tooke an herbe and eate it, &amp; as ſoone that he had it: he ſwelled like a padde, and than he tooke an other herbe, &amp; chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed it and helde it betwene hys teeth, and anon he became al blacke as a cole in his face os one that is beaten with ſtaues, &amp; his eyen reeled in hys

And whan he was thus turned and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefayt: he tooke a great mantell and a hoode &amp; clothed himſelfe therwith and tooke on his feet a greate payre of bootes and the ſtaffe of a pilgrime in his hande. And thus arayed: he iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of Mountawban. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was out: he ſet himſelfe for to goe the way ſo greate paſe that no horſe could not haue waloped ſo faſt, tyll that he came to mountbendel, before the centes of the emperour Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne or euer that Rowlande were come there againe, and there he helde him ſtil and ſpake nothing at all, but looked onely vpon the kyng and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his pauyllion. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went: he halted with the one foote, &amp; lened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the kinges tent vpon his ſtaffe, and kepte the one of his eyen cloſe.</p>
            <p>And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw the kyng come oute of his pauyllion: he nighed him and ſaid God of heauen that ſuffred deth and paſſion on the croſſe, keep you kyng Charlemain fro deth and from priſon, and from euil treaſon.</p>
            <p>VAſſail ſaid the kinge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayn god confounde you for I ſhall neuer truſte vpon ſuche a begger as ye be, bycauſe of the euyll theef Mawgis, the whiche hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued me many times, for whan he wil, he is a palmer a knight or a gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon or elles a heremyte, by ſuche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that I canne not beware of hym And if it pleaſe god &amp; his bleſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther I ſhal auenge me once vpon him howe that the game goeth. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mawgys hearde the Emperoure ſpeake of this maner: he anſwered nothynge, and kepte hym ſtyl a great whyle, and after he ſayd to the king. Syr yf Mawgys be a theefe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poore folke be not ſo. I haue more need of helthe, than I haue to doo any treaſon, and it is well ſeen on me that I am not the bodye that might doo any great harme. Syr I come from Iheruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where I haue worſhypped the holy graue, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue doone my oblacions in the temple of Salomon, and yet I muſt goe to rome and to ſaint Iames in galyce &amp; God will. But I dyd paſſe yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye ouer balancon and ouer Giron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, with .x. men my ſeruauntes that I ledde alwaies by the waye with me for to keep &amp; defende my bodye. And whan I had paſſed ouer Gyronde: I came with my men throughe a wood nighe Mountawban, where I met with many brygantes and theues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſlewe all my men and all that I had they took fro me, and let me goe, and gladde I was whan ſo fayre I was deliuered of theim. And after I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the folke of the countrey what menne they were that ſo hadde ſlaine my men, and they dyd tell me that they were the foure ſonnes of Aymo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and a greate theefe that was called Mawgis with theym. And I aſked them why they wold ſet themſelfe to ſo foule a craft &amp; vnhappy, ſeen that they were ſo greate gentilmen born? and the people of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de me that they were conſtrained for
<pb n="xci" facs="tcp:7017:96"/> to doo ſo bycauſe they had ſo greate pouertie within Mountawban that they wiſt nor what to doo. But I did neuer ſee ſo cruel a man as the ſame Mawgys is, for he bounde my han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des behinde my backe whan he had robbed me, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bet me ſo ſore: that I weened to haue dyed therof, and hath araied me as ye ſee. Syr ye be the beſt kynge in the worlde and ye be the lorde of all this land, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you for god that ye wyl doo me ryght of theſe four ſonnes of Aymon and of Mawgis that greate theefe. And whan Charlemain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood theſe wordes: he ryghted his heade vp, &amp; ſaid. Pylgryme is it true as thou ſaieſt? yea ſir ſaid Mawgis. Nowe tell me thy name ſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne. Sir ſaid Mawgys, my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is Gaidon, &amp; I am borne in Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne &amp; I am a great man in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, wherfore I require you in the worſhyppe of the holye ſepulcre that I haue ſought: that ye doo me ryght. Pylgrime ſayde Charlemaine I can not haue no ryght of them my ſelfe, for I promyſe thee if I had them: all the worlde ſhould not ſaue them, but that I ſhoulde make them dye a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meful deathe. Syr ſayde then Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys, ſith that ye can do me no ryghte of theym: I beſeche almightye god that is in heuen that it pleaſeth him for to doo it. Syr ſaide the barons thys pilgrime ſemeth to be a good man and a true as we ſuppoſe. For it is well ſeen on him, geue to hym your almeſſe yf it pleaſe you. And thenne the kinge commaunded that men ſhould giue him twentye pound of money, and Mawgis tooke them and put it in his hoode, and he ſaide in himſelfe, ye haue gyuen to me of your own good but ye haue doon like a foole. I ſhal rewarde you ryght e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel for it or euer I departe fro you, &amp; whan he had the ſyluer: he aſked for ſome meate for gods ſake, and oure ladyes, for ſythe yeſterdaye he hadde not eaten as he ſaid, by my faith ſaid Charlemaine thou ſhalt haue meat &amp; drinke ynoughe. And anon they did brynge him meate, and he ſette him downe and tooke and eate wel of the beſt. And the king ſaide to him nowe eat free good pilgrim. For thou ſhalt be wel ſerued, and Mawgys eat ſtyl &amp; anſwered neuer a word but beheld onely the king in hys vyſage. And the kinge ſaide to him tell me Pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gryme and hide no thynge from me, whi haſt thou loked ſo on me? ſir ſaid Mawgis I ſhall tel you with a good wyll. Wyt that I am a wel trauayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led man, but in no place that euer I was, I ſaw neyther chriſten man ne ſaraſyn ſo goodly a prince, ne ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as ye be one, wherof of all the pardones that I haue wonne in my vyage makinge. I giue you the haue freely. Certes pilgrime ſaid the king and I take it gladlye. And I thanke you muche therof. And Mawgys gaue hym for a witneſſe of the ſame his palmers ſtaffe for to kyſſe it, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid the barons euery chone certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſyr the pylgryme hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you a verye fayre gyfte, ye oughte to rewarde him wel for it. Syr ſaid thenne Mawgis I aſke none other rewarde of you for it but that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe you for to take my poore gyfte a worthe, and that I may reſt my ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:7017:97"/> heere a while for I am verye ſycke &amp; wery. And thus as the kynge ſpake to Mawgys: came than Rowlande and Oliuer. and al their folke, that brought Richard for a priſoner.</p>
            <p>ANd whan Ogier &amp; Eſtorfawd the ſonne of Oedon, and the duke Naimes ſaw that Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land wold goe to the pauilio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine with Richard: They came to Rowlande and ſaide to him. Syr Rowland howe can ye hate Richard ſo ſore that ye wyll yeeld hym to Charlemaine? Lordes ſaid Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what wyll ye that I ſhall doo wyth him: tell me and I ſhall doo it.

               </gap>her priſoner. Lordes ſayd Row<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande yf I canne doo this: I ſhal doo it gladly. And theſe wordes hearde a yoman, that incontinent ſpurred his horſe, and came to the kinges tent, &amp; ſaid to Charlemayne. Syr I bringe you tydynges ſore ſtraunge, we haue foughten by the ryuer ſyde of Balancon, where that Reinawd the ſonne of Aymon hath keept his own right well ayenſt Rowland your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uew, and ſetteth not a ſtraw by him. And Rowland loſt there more than he wan. Whan the Emperoure char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne vnderſtood that worde: he was abaſſhed greatlye, and after he ſaid to the yoman. Tel me my freend howe was yet of my neuewe Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? Sir ſaid the yoman, he fought with the foure ſonnes of Aimon, that defended themſelfe well. But Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande hath brought with him pryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner one of the foure ſonnes of Aimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which is the moſt hardy and the moſt valiaunt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al in al pointes.</p>
            <p>CHarlemayn began than to lepe for Ioye whan he vnderſtoode theſe tydynges, and came out of his tent, and behelde and ſawe Rychard that Rowlande broughte, and whan Charlemayne ſawe Richarde: he knewe him well incontinente, and began to crie for greate Ioye that he had. By my ſoule neuewe it is well ſeen that ye haue ben there. For elles Richarde ſhoulde not haue ben take. Certes ſir ſaid Rowlande, well lied Ogierro you, for yf he hadde not be: the foure ſonnes of Aimon were take aſwell as one, and than ſaid the king to Rychard. Whoreſone by the faith that I owe to god, ye ſhal be hanged by the necke, but fyrſt ye ſhall haue of euil and of tormentes ynoughe ſir ſaid Richard I am in pryſon. I feare me not to be hanged as longe as my brother ſhal may lyght vpon bayard and that Mawgys be alyue, Alarde, and Guicharde my ryghte deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, for if ye do to me any outrage: no caſtell, ne town, ne fortreſſe ſhal not keep you, but they ſhal make you dye an euell deathe or two dayes be paſſed. Whan Charlemayne heard Richard ſpeake ſo proudlye: he was ryghte an angred for it, and tooke a ſtaffe with bothe hys handes and ſmote Richard therwith vpon hys heade ſo hard that he made the bloud renne out of it to the earthe, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Richarde felte himſelfe thus woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: he vaunced him ſelfe, and tooke themperour Charlemain with both the
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:7017:97"/> hys armes by the waſte &amp; wraſtled to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gither a longe whyle, ſo that they fell both downe the one heere, &amp; the other there. And Rycharde roſe vp quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wolde haue renne vpon Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne but Ogyer, and Salamon ſeaſſed him and kept him therfro, and after they ſayd to Charlemayne. Syr ye haue doone ouermuche amys, for to beate a pryſoner. Certes my lordes ſaide Richarde it is more dyſhonoure to the kynge to ſmite me, than it is to me for to defende my bodye, but he is well wunt to doo ſuche outrages, for it is not the fyrſte that he hathe doone, nor it ſhall not be the laſt. And whan Mawgis ſawe that Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn had ſmytten Rychard: he was ſore an angred therfore, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt layed vpon him wyth his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers ſtaffe, but he thought yf he had doo ſo: bothe Richarde and he ſhoulde haue be dead. And whan Charlemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſawe that Richarde ſpake ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: he ſayde to hym. Rycharde God confounde me, yf ye ſcape me for all your wickednes, for ye ſhall ſoone be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged by the necke. Syr ſayd Richard ſpeake more courteouſlye yf it pleaſe you. For I ſhal ſee you ſooner be flein quicke than ye ſhall ſee me hange, nor ye ſhall not be ſo hardye to doo ſo, what ſomeuer ye prate, ſaye or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. Charlemayne ſayd, ye ſhall not ſcape me but ye ſhall be hanged or nyghte, and wolde God I helde as faſt youre bretherne, and Mawgys that theef as I holde you nowe, for they ſhoulde be hanged wyth you to beare you company, becauſe ye ſhould not be afetde. And thus as Rycharde ſtroue with Charlemayne: he turned hymſelfe and ſawe Mawgys behin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de hym that helde him ſelfe ſtyll le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge vpon hys ſtaffe, and he knew hym well wherof he was wel gladde for he wyſt well he ſhoulde not dye ſyth Mawgys was there.

And whan Reinawd ſawe him come without Richarde: he was full ſory ſo that he fell do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Holde your peace traytours ſayd Reynawd for ye haue loſt the beſt knyghte of the worlde, for I ſee Mawgis come alone, wherfore I beleue that Richa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rde is deade, for yf he were a lyue: Mawgys wolde haue broughte hym with him. For he neuer myſſed of no

And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alard, &amp; Guychard vnderſtood theſe wordes: they tooke therof ſo greate a ſorowe that they fell both downe in a ſwoune to the earthe, and whan they were come againe to theim ſelfe they made ſo great ſorow that it was pytie for to ſee. And this ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging: cam there Mawgis. And whan he ſawe the great ſorow that his coſyns made: he was wrothe for it, and ſayde to them. What eyleth you faire coſyns that ye make ſo euill cheere. Alas Mawgys ſaid Reinawd, what is doone of oure brother Richard. Coſyn ſayd Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis Richard is yet in priſon, but Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemaine hath ſaide that he ſhall make him to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged at the gybet of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fawcon, and hathe ſayde that ye ſhall not keepe him longe a liue leſte ye and I ſhould reſcue him, and heere is .xx. li. of money that Charlemayne hathe gyue me in his pauillion and made me haue both meat, and drynke, at my pleaſure. Nowe ſhall it be ſeen yf ye loue Richard, &amp; if ye be a good knight or not, for ye muſt ſuccour and deliuer him by force of armes or elles he ſhal die, for all the world ſhal not keep him otherwiſe therfro.</p>
            <p>REinawd was wel recomforted whan he heard Mawgis ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: and after he ſayd, ſith that it is ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Richarde is yet aliue: if I had but my ſelfe, my brethern, and Mawgis, yet ſhould I keep Richard fro death maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gre the power of Charlemayne, &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mawgis without any longe abiding tooke of his cope &amp; his hod, and tooke an herbe &amp; eat it, &amp; anon the ſwellinge went fro him, &amp; whan he was armed: he preſented himſelf to Reinawd, and incontinent all his brethern put them ſelfe in armes, and anon they tooke their way toward mountfawco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And whan they were come to a bowe ſhot nyghe fro it: Reynawde ſayde to hys folke. Lordes if ye euer loued me: thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke for to doo nowe ſo muche that my brother Richard may be reſcued from this ſhamefull death. For I promyſe you that I ſhal brynge hym with me, or els I and my bretherne and Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys ſhall die with him. Syr ſayde his men doubte not of vs, for we ſhal doo oure deuoyre. Brother ſayde than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, let vs lyghte heere down, and let vs hyde oure ſelfe within that buſhe that we ſee yonder, for yf we were ſeen: the frenſhmen mighte kille oure brother Richarde, or euer they wolde come. Brother ſaid Reynawd ye ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke wiſely, and than they lyghted down a foote, and put themſelfe in a buſſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within a wood that was nighe mountfawcon.

            <p>HOw they were ſent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine of Valcoloures ye haue well hearde, and the paine that reynawd &amp; his bretherne ſuffred and than howe they wente and ſuccoured kynge yon of Gaſcoyn that had betrayed theim.

<pb n="xciii" facs="tcp:7017:98"/> were enbuſhed vnder the ſarpyn trees they fell into ſo harde a ſlepe, that they forgate Richard. Now god for his pytie, haue pytie vpon him, &amp; keep him. For otherwiſe he muſt die.</p>
            <p>NOw ſhal we tel you of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine that was in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyllio, he called to him the duke Nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Richard of Normandy and ſaide to them. Lordes what counſeil gyue you me? ye knowe that Richard the ſoone of Aymon is of great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I feare me that Reynawde ſhall come to ſuccoure hym, whan I ſhall ſende him for to be hanged, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt ſend company for to with ſtande Reynawde, his bretherne and Mawgis. And thus as the king and the duke Naymes ſpake togither: he looked before him &amp; ſawe Berenger of valoys, and called him and ſaid to him. Berenger ye are of my men for ye holde of me ſcotlande &amp; Wales, ye oughte to come ſerue me in Fraunce with all youre power euery yere once whan I haue need. I ſhall now quite you and releaſe vnto you all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe that ye owe me, to you &amp; to youre heires for euermore ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye will take richarde the ſonne of Aymon and ſee that he be hanged and ſtrangeled at mountfawcon. And yf reynawd com there for to reſcue hym: I praye you that ye wil take in hand my quarell. Syr ſaid Berenger I ſee well now that ye loue me but a lytell, whan ye ſende me to doo ſuche a deed, it were to me a great ſhame yf I dyd it, for nothynge that is to my dyſworſhippe I wyll not doo wyth my good wil, and alſo ye ought not to counſeyll me to it nor ſuffre me to doo ſo, yet haue I leuet to ſerue you as my dutye is for to doo, than that I ſhould doo the ſame that ye wolde put me to. And whan Charlemaine ſawe that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renger wolde not doo it: he called to therle Guydellon &amp; ſaid to him. Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellon ye be my man and holdeth Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyere of me, and ye ought to ſerue me at any time that I call you with three thouſand men, yf ye will goe hange Richard the ſonne of Aymon: I ſhall make you free, and ſhall giue you the citie of Maſcon. I wil not doo it ſaid therle Guydellon. But I tell you for certeine that Richarde ſhall haue no harme if I may help him fro it to my power. Than ſaide Charlemayn goe oute of my ſighte for ye be no good men. And than he ſaide to Rycharde by god yet ſhall ye be hanged in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyte of theym. Than called Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne Ogier the dane, and ſaide to him Ogier ye be my man, it is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto me that ye did the other daye treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ayenſt me in the plain of Val-colours for loue of Reynawde, nowe ſhall it be ſeene if it is true or not. Yf ye wyll goe hange Richarde: I ſhall gyue you the cite of Lion, and I ſhall gyue you quit of al the ſeruiſe that ye owe me &amp; youre heyres alſo for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.

<pb facs="tcp:7017:99"/> he yet ſhall be hanged. And whan he had ſaide ſo: he called to him the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe Turpyn and ſayd to hym. Ye byſhop I ſhal make you Pope of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me yf ye will hange Richard, ſyr ſaid the byſhop Turpyn, what ſay ye? ye knowe wel that I am a preeſte, yf I dyd ſo: I ſhould leſe my maſſe and be reguler, and alſo ye knowe well that rycharde is my coſyn. Wolde ye that I ſhoulde commyt treaſon vpon my kynſmen? certes it were ayenſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So help me god ſaid Charlemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ye leaue it neither for kynred nor for maſſe, but as a cowarde ye leaue it onelye for feare that youre crowne ſhould be beat.</p>
            <p>THan called Charlemayne Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of breton &amp; ſaid to him, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon ye knowe well that ye be my man and that ye holde Breten of me, I ſhal giue you the duchie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom yf ye will hange rycharde the ſonne of Aymon. Syr anſwered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon, if it pleaſe you to commaunde me any other thinge I wil be readye to doo it with a good will, but this I will not doo. And I tell you for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that rycharde ſhall haue no harme yf I maye. Salamon ſayd the kinge, ye be a traytoue ſith that ye wyll not doo my commaundemente. And after this: he ſayde Richarde I will that ye knowe well that ye ſhal be hanged in dyſpite of all thy kynſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Syr ſaide richarde perauenture it ſhall be other wiſe thanye weene. and than Charlemayne turned hym ſelfe towarde Rowlande, and ſaid to hym Fayre nenewe goe and ſee that he be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged I pray you. For it is well reaſon that ye doo thoffice, ſyth thar all the frenſhemen haue faylled me, and alſo ye haue taken him, wherfore ye muſt needes hange him, and I ſhal gyue you Coleyn vpon the ryn and ſo many other countreys that ye ſhal haue ynough. Sir anſwered rowland yf I dyd this: I ſhoulde be taken for a traytour. For I haue anſwered ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde afore that I tooke hym that he ſhoulde haue no harme of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and yf ye make hym dye: no man ſhall neuer truſte me vpon my faith. wherfore I praye the .xii. peeres of Fraunce that none of them wyll take the charge vpon hym for to ſee hym ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, for yf he were ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged: I ſhould be diffamed. And I promiſe you that who ſhall hange Rychard: I ſhal goe to Reynawde and ſhall put my ſelfe in his pryſon, and yf he wyll pardon me hys brothers deathe: I ſhal help him vnder my othe ayenſt all menne with three thouſande fyghtinge men well atayed on horſebacke.

Lordes ye knowe well that I am the ſonne of kinge Pepin and of the Quene Bethe, my father was nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Fraunce, and I ſledde in to Spayn to Alaffre vpon the ſea.

And I am delybered to enquire eche of you by this maner for to ſee who ſhall be falſe or true to me. Whan Charlemaine had ſayde this: he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towarde the ſonne of Oedon and ſayde to him.

Whan the kinge heard that he was thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: he tooke a ſtaffe and caſt it after Eſtorfawd, but Eſtorfawd ſtert from his place, and the ſtaffe brake in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ayenſt a poſt. And whan the .xii. peeres ſaw that: they went all oute of the pauyllyon of Charlemayne, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Charlemain returned him, and ſaw that none of all the .xii. pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res wolde abyde there with him:</p>
            <p>Than he ſaide to the duke Naymes where be my .xii. peeres gone? ſir ſaid duke Naymes, they ben all gone out of your pauillion, and not without a cauſe, for it becometh not to ſuche a noble kinge as ye be to ſmyte his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, for ye ſhould be ſore blamed.</p>
            <p>THan whan Charlemayn ſaw this: he called to him Richard of montrolonde &amp; ſaide to hym, come foorthe Rycharde of montrolonde, heare what I ſhal tell you, ye knowe well that ye be one of theym that I loue beſt in this worlde but ye muſt doo one thinge at my requeſt.

            <p>THe kinge than called to hym the duke Naymes, and ſayde to him.

For it is wel xvi. yeres that it began fyrſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a noble knight hathe be ſlayne for the ſame, if it pleaſe you ye ſhall ſend worde to Reinawde, Alarde, Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and Mawgys that they wyl become your men, and ye ſhall dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer agayne vnto them theyr brother Rycharde alyue, and that ye wyl doo make Reinawde and Alarde of the xii. peeres of Fraunce. And whan Reinawd &amp; his brethern ſhal ſe that ye haue doone to theym ſo great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp: they ſhall ſerue you with good herte, and ſo that ye ſhall con them greate thanke for it, and I enſure you ye ſhal be the more dredde and more redoubted for cauſe of theym, and yf ye haue once the foure bretherne and Mawgis theyr coſyn to youre freen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: there ſhall be no prynce in all chriſtendom ſo hardy that dare moue watre ayenſt you, and I promiſe you ſyr that the more that ye keepe thys warre ayenſt them: the more ſhall ye loſe therby, and moreouer they be all of our houſe by theyr father Aymon, this know ye wel, and thefore I can not hate them by no wyſe, Naymes ſayd Charlemaine. I will not doo ſo for they all haue doone amys ayenſt me and ſo ſhall I doo hange Richard by the faithe of my bodye, ſyr ſayde the duke Naymes ye ſhall not doo ſo and god wyll, for he is of greate lyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage &amp; of our lignage, for we ſhoulde neuer maye ſuffre it nor endure, and ye alſo ſhoulde be blamed ful ſore for it. But and ye wyl make hym dye: I ſhall gyue you better counſeyll. Tell me howe ſayd Charlemayn, &amp; I ſhall doo it, yf it ſemeth me good, Syr ſayde the duke Naymes ſyth it pleaſe you that Richarde ſhall dye: let him be caſt into a deep priſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earthe, and make him to be kepte ſurely therin that he ſcape not awaye, and commaund that no meat at all be broughte vnto him, and ſo ſhall he dye for hungre. And ye ſhall not be blamed if ye doo ſo. Naymes ſayde the Emperour Charlemayne, ye doo Iape with me. I knowe it wel whan ye doo tell me this, ye knowe well that Mawgis is to great a ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancer. For I ſhould neuer may keepe Richarde in pryſon, but that Mawgis wolde haue hym out tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:7017:100"/> his craft, and therfore I wyll not doo as ye ſay.

But this daye ſhal be ſeen who loueth richard. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ogier had ſaid this: he went oute of the pauillion, and Eſcoufe with him and Richarde of Normandy, the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Turpin and Guidellon of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyere, and made theyr folke to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, &amp; whan they were armed: they were well .xii. thouſande men. And than Ogier began to crie with a hie voice. Now ſhal it be ſeen who ſhal be ſo hardy for to leade Richarde the ſonne of Aimon to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng. For ſuch ſhall bring him that neuer ſhal come againe, but he be headles, and Ogier went in to the pauyllyon where richarde was, that was bound both handes and feet, and was blindfeld. And whan Ogyer ſawe rycharde that was thus arayed: he had of hym greate pytie, ſo went he to him to haue deliuered him, but he aduyſed himſelfe, and ſayd that he ſhould not doo it, but he wolde tary for to ſee an ende of it what the kynge ſhould doo therof. And whan rycharde hearde Ogier ſpeake: he called to hym and ſaid in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the duke Naimes and of rycharde of Normandye, of Guydellon of Bauyere, and of the byſhoppe Turpyn, and of rowlande that than happed to com thete.

Whan Ogier ſawe rycharde ſpeake ſo: he was ſo ſorye for it that he fell almoſt downe to the grounde for greate ſorowe in ſwoune, and ſaide to rycharde in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre. What ſayeſt thou foole deteſtable wylte thou be hanged? for yf we ſaid the ſame that thou ſayeſt to Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne: all the golde of the worlde ſhoulde not ſaue thee, but that thou ſhouldeſt ſoone be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> necke. I care not ſaide Rycharde, happe as it happe wyll. And than he turned himſelfe toward rowlande and ſayde to him. I pardon you ſyr rowlande heere and afore god the faithe that ye haue promiſed me, and that ye gaue me whan ye tooke me afore Balanco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And whan Ogier heard this: he wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt mad for greate angre, and ſaide to rowlande. Syr beleue not rycharde, for he ſpeaketh as a man that is vexed in his ſpirites, and not without a very great cauſe, but keepe vnto him the fayth that ye haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, for it ſhall be youre greate worſhyp, yf ye doo ſo.

            <p>THan ſayde Charlemayne, by my faith now ye ſpeake wel and wyſelye, &amp; now I pardon you al, and than Charlemaine called to hym Ripus of ryplemond and ſaid to him Rypus if ye wil doo ſo muche for me that ye will goe hange Rycharde: I ſhall make thee lorde of great londes and ye ſhall be my chamberleyne all your lyfe.

And whan typus hadde taken the othe of the .xii. peeres of fraunce for his ſuretye: he went to his owne tente, and made him to be armed, And whan he was armed: he lyghted on horſebacke, and came before kyng Charlemain. And whan the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſawe him: he ſayde to hym.

            <p>NOwe ſhall we ſpeake of bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde the good horſe of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd, of his brethern and Mawgis.

And than theyr folke put themſelfe in ordenaunce, and they abode behinde til that their folke had paſſed Bala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>con.

            <p>ANd wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde had ſayd this: he came to the water of Balancon, and paſſed ouer with his three thouſande men, And they rode ſo longe that they came to the hoſte of Charlemayne, that was wrothe more than meſure requireth bicauſe that he had loſte the feelde agaynſt Reynawde. And whan Reynawde ſawe the pauilion of Charlemayne: he ſayd to his brethern, and to al his folke, I praye you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye gouerne you wyſely. Syr ſayd Richard the hardy he that wyll be enhaunced in pryce: he ought not to looke ſo nygh, but he muſt Ieoparde for to conquere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp. And whan Richarde had ſayd ſo: he ſet hande to his ſwerde, &amp; ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his horſe with the ſpurres and wente ſtreyght to the pauylyon of Charlemayne, &amp; cut of the cordes &amp; made it fall downe to the erth with the Egle of golde maſſy that was of great value. Whan Reynawde ſawe this: he called Mawgis &amp; ſaid to him coſin come hyther, helpe me to bring a way this gayne, ſyr ſayd Mawgis with a good will, and they lighted a foote &amp; tooke the Egle of golde that was ſo riche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man wilte what it was worth, &amp; Reynawde ſayd to his folke. My lordes ſmite now well &amp; fayne not your ſelfe, he that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a game: he ought to ſee an ende of it to his profyte yf he can. Who than had ſeene the folke of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne arme them &amp; com out of their tentes &amp; ranne vpon the ſonnes of Aymon: he wolde haue meruayled, &amp; it was pitie for to ſee the great ſlau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghter that was doone there.

By my head ſyr Emperour, ye haue troubled vs ſore a longe whyle, but ye ſhall bye it ful deere at this houre your comyng into Gaſcoyne &amp; the death of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the duke benes of Aigremount. for I ſhal giue to you ſuch a ſtroke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſhal neuer make warre to vs nor to none other.

<pb n="Ciii" facs="tcp:7017:108"/> he looked about him and ſaw not Reynawde nor his brethern, for they had put themſelf to the way to retourne home agayne.</p>
            <p>OVer longe taried Mawgis in the hoſte of Charlemayne, for Reynawde was all redy paſſed ouer Balancon, and Rowland &amp; Oliuer were all redy come to the callinge of Charlemayne ſore afrayed, &amp; whan Mawgis ſawe them: he made no len<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger taryinge, but gaue the ſpurres to his horſe &amp; went after Reynawde as faſt as his horſe myght runne.</p>
            <p>And whan he wolde haue paſſed ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>con: he met wyth a great company of the folke of Charlemayne, and Mawgis ſmote one of them ſo hard in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſheeld, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ouerthrew both horſe &amp; man to the erth.

Ha fayre coſin Reynawde where be you, ſuccour me for god. for if ye loſe me: ye ſhal haue harme therat. And than Mawgys thought well that Reynawde was gone, this hangynge: came Olyuer throughe the preſe and came vpon Mawgis &amp; ſmote him ſo harde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it abode not nother for ſheelde nor for courſet of ſteele, but he made hym a wounde in his breſte, and caſte hym downe to the erth.</p>
            <p>WHan Mawgis felt hymſelfe thus hurt and ouerthrowen: he was ryght wrothe for it. So roſe he vp quickly vpon his feete &amp; tooke hys ſwearde in his hande &amp; did mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles of armes, and the nyght was very darke that almoſte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one knew not the other. And whan Oliuer ſaw Mawgys defende hymſelf ſo well: he ſayde to him. I knowe not thee knight whom thou art, but and thou yeeld not thy ſelfe to me: I ſhall now ſmyte of thy head from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhoulders. what is thy name ſayd than Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys? for and thou be a good man I ſhall yeelde me to thee and els not, knight my name is Oliuer of Vien. whan Mawgys heard him named: he knew him well, and ſayd to hym, Ha gentyll knight Oliuer I yeelde me to you vpon your fayth &amp; vnder ſuche a condycion that ye ſhall not delyuer me to Charlemayn, for if ye delyuer me in his handes I am dead wythout remedy &amp; he ſhall make me dye ſhamefully as a theefe. By my fayth ſayd Olyuer this wyll I not doo for I dare not hyde you from Charlemayne, but yeelde you and I promiſe you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhal help you to my power for to make your apoyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the king, ſir ſayd Mawgys, &amp; I yeeld me to you vpon your trouth and tooke his ſwerde to hym &amp; Oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tooke it, &amp; after made hym to be lighted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a litle horſe, &amp; brought him to the pauilion of Charlemaine where they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng, bycauſe he was al afrayed as ye heard afore. And whan Oliuer ſaw that he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not Charlemaine: he was ſore aferd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mawgys ſhould ſcape from hym through his incantacions &amp; wytche crafte, and ſayd to him, Mawgis ye know how I haue taken you by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and that ye are my pryſoner, I wyll y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye gyue me your fayth truly

And whan Oliuer had taken the othe of Mawgys: he made him to be vnarmed, and made hys wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to be wrapped: and gaue him a mantell vpon him and made hym to lye vpon a bed. Now ſhal we leue a litle to ſpeake of Charlemayne, of Olyuer and of Mawgys. And ſhal ſhew of Reynawde and his brethern what they dyd whan the hoſt of char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne was moued, and how they wonne the Egle of Golde that was of ſo great value, &amp; how Reynawde ſayd to his brethern, lordes let vs ſe now for to quyte vs wel, for it were not good for vs for to tary heere ani lenger. And than he made to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his folke, and made them put to the waye. And as they wente: Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard ſayd to Reynawde. Syr wee haue gotten a ryche proy thanked be God. For Charlemayne ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a longe day wrothe therfore. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſayd Reynawde fayre brother ye ſaye trouth and alſo we haue ſlayne a great many of hys folke. Ha God ſayde than Alarde, where is our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin Mawgis? for I ſe him not heere Brother ſayd Richard, be not aferde for Mawgys, for I beleue that he is gone to Mountawban afore vs, god be with hym whereſoeuer he be ſayd Reynawde. For he is right ſage, and a noble knyght. I wolde not for all the Golde in the world that my coſin Mawgis had ani harme. ¶ We ſhal leue a lytle to ſpeake of Reynawde and hys brethern that are bounde to Mountawban glad of theyr proye: And ſhall nowe ſpeake of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne that was ſo ſore wrothe as I haue ſayde afore.</p>
            <p>WHan Charlemayne was fro his harneys: he fel in a ſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une for the greate angre that he had of that he had be thus diſtreſſed. And whan he was come agayne to hym ſelfe: he ſente for the duke Naymes the biſſhoppe Turpyn, Eſcoufe the ſonne of Oedon for Salamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, Richarde of Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erle Guydellon and for Ogier the dane. And whan they were all gathered to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether: the kynge began to ſhewe to them his complayntes in thys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Lordes I haue kepte and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned you vnder mi tuicion y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of .xl. yeres and more that no man hath not wronged you of a penye, &amp; ye haue no neyghbour that dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke you any thinge. Now me ſemeth becauſe that I am now olde that I am but half a man &amp; yet not ſo good as I wolde be, and I maye not be a kyng without you: for whan ye faile me I am no kynge, ye know well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye haue left me for loue of Reynawd wherof I am ryght ſory as I maye well, for Reynawde hath taken me where I was habandoned of you, &amp; he hath chaſed me out of the feeld, certes I am worſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mad of thys y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye haue forſake me for Reynawde. And ſyth that it is thus wyth me: I ſeeke not to lyue anye lenger, nor to be kynge any more, and now I take to you the crowne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende that ye ſhall gyue it vnto Reynawde whan ye wyll, and that ye make him king of Fraunce. For I wyll be no more
<pb n="ciiii" facs="tcp:7017:109"/> your kynge.</p>
            <p>WHan the .xii. peeres of Fraunce, &amp; the other lordes hearde Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayn ſpeake ſo ſorowfullye: thei were ſore abaſhed that there was no man ſo hardye that durſt ſaye one worde. And the one looked vpon the other and were abaſhed. And whan the duke Naimes of bauiere vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the wordes of Charlemain: he put him ſelf forth and ſaid. Sir Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour god forbyd that ye ſhould doo as ye ſaye, for it were great ſhame to vs all and alſo to you, but I wot wel that we haue myſpryſed ayenſt you in that we haue ſupported Reinaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, but ye oughte to conſydre that we haue doone, was by no malyce: but for good entencion. For we wend for to haue made the peace of the warre that hath endured ſo longe, wherby many good true men are deade, but ſith that we ſee, that it pleaſeth not you to make peace with the four ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: take again your crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and be not wroth with vs, and we ſhal promyſe you that we al ſhal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue you well and truely, and that we ſhal take Mountawban or a moneth be paſſed, or elles we ſhall die all, &amp; from hence forth on he that ſhal ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the foure ſonnes of Aimon, ſhal be ſlaine of vs. Than ſaide the kinge Charlemayne, lette all this alone I tell you for certaine that I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be your kynge, but ye yeeld to me Reynawde or Mawgis the curſed theef that hathe mocked me ſo often. And whan Charlemaine had ſaide this: he entred within his pauilion ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re an angred. And than came theere Olyuer that was ſore abaſhed of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſawe the king make ſo euill chere, and after he ſaide to Charlemayne. Syr wherof are ye ſo ſore angry? by my faith ſaide the duke Naymes he hath ſhamed vs, for he hath forſaken his crowne and his realme. Sir ſaid than Olyuer doo not ſo, but take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yen your crown and be our lorde and our kyng. And who dooth not youre commaundemente: chaſtyſe him in ſuch a maner that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take enſample therby. Olyuer ſaide Charlemayn, ye ſpeake for nought, for I wyll not doo it, but I haue Reinawd or Maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gis dead or quicke, ſyr ſaide Olyuer now pardon vs than, &amp; I ſhal dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to you Mawgis or euyn.</p>
            <p>DAmp Oliuer ſayd Charlemain I am not a chylde, wherof men ought to mocke with. For I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oe well that Mawgis doubteth you of nothing. Syr ſaid Olyuer, yf ye will promyſe me that ye ſhall take again your crowne, and that ye ſhall keep vs as ye haue doone afore tyme: I ſhall bringe him nowe afore you, by my faithe ſayde Charlemayne yf ye doo it, and that I maye haue hym at my will (for I hate hym moſt of all men in the worlde) I ſhal doo al that ye will deſire of me, and alſo I ſhall giue you londes ynough that ye ſhal be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of me, for if Mawgys were not: the ſonnes of Aymon myght not endure ayenſt me, for yf I had them in priſon, and thoughe I had ſworn to keep them, yet ſhoulde that theefe Mawgis ſtele theym awaie fro me. Syr ſaid Olyuer I ſhall bryng him to you witout any doubte. And than
<pb facs="tcp:7017:110"/> Olyuer went to his pauylyon and Rowland with him, and many other knightes for to ſee Mawgis. Oliuer ſayde then to Mawgis, Mawgys ye muſt come to Charlemayne. Oliuer ſaide Mawgys, ye haue betrayed me, but I wot well that Charlemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſhall be more curteous than ye haue be, for he ſhall do me no harme, and let vs goe to him in the name of god whan ye wyll. And than Oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ledde Mawgys to Charlemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and whan he was within the pauillion: he went ſtreighte to the king and ſaide to him. Syr ye haue promiſed me that if I brought Maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gis: that ye ſhould take againe youre crowne. And that ye ſhould keep vs to right as ye haue doone afore time. Certes ſaide Charlemain it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, and if ye keep your couenaunt: I ſhall doo that I haue promyſed you. Now holde you ſir ſaide Olyuer he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Mawgis, that I delyuer to you for to doo your pleaſure with him the which I haue take and conquered by force of armes. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kyng Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine ſawe Mawgis: he was ſo gladde that no man mighte be more, and after he ſaide, by my fayth nowe haue I one parte of my deſyre, thou falſe theef Mawgys now I holde thee, nowe ſhalt thou be rewarded of thy pride that thou haſt ſhewed to me whan thou bareſt awaye myne egle of golde, and for all the good turnes and theftes that thou haſt doone in thy daies. For many times thou haſt angred me ſore, wherof thou ſhalte be nowe payed after thy deſeruynge. Syr ſaide then Mawgis ye ſhal doo with me what it pleaſe you, for I am now in your handes, but I counſeyll you for the beſt that ye let me goe and that ye make peace with Reinawde, and with his bretherne, for ye ſhall get no thinge by my deathe, and my coſins been ſuch that they ſhall aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge it right wel by force of armes, and if ye doo as I ſaie: ye ſhall haue with you the floure of knighthode of all the worlde. A theef ſaid Charlemain how fearful thou arte now. Certes this that thou ſayeſt ſhall auaylle the nothynge. Syr ſaide Mawgis I am no theefe. Now can I not doo no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing ſith that I am in your handes. And whan ye ſhall haue put me to death: ye ſhal doo me no more nothin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and yet ye ſhal be ſory for me or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer .xiiii. houres comen at an ende. Rybawd ſaide Charlemaine, ſpeake not ſo boldly, for &amp; I can: thou ſhalte haue an euil night or euer thou ſcape me, nor the glutons thy coſyns ſhall not helpe the therfro, but that I ſhall make the die in diſpite of al thy witch craft that thou canneſt doo. ☞ Now we ſhal leue a litel to ſpeake of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain and of Mawgis: and we ſhal ſpeake of the good knight Reynawde Alard, of Guichard, and of the litylle Richard his brethern.</p>
            <p>WHan Reynawd was departed from the hoſte of Charlemayn as I ſayde before: he rode ſo longe that he came to Mountawban and his folke with hym. And whan that lady wiſt that her lord came: ſhe came him ayenſt, and ſaid to hym.</p>
            <p>Sir ye bee righte welcome, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ye deliuered Rycharde? yea,

And than ſhe went to Rycharde and kyſſed hym more than ten tymes, &amp; there was a cheere and a feaſt made ryght amyable. And after they had made greate Ioye: Reynawd began to demaunde after hys coſin, and the lady anſwered, my lorde I knowe no tydynges of hym, and whan Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde heard that: he was ſore agaſt of it, and turned himſelfe towarde hys bretherne and ſayde to theym. My bretherne I praye you that we may know whether our coſyn maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis is come or not, and goe ſeeke him in his lodges, for haply he is goe for to vnarme him ſelfe. And inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Guicharde and Richard ſought hym at thys lodges and aſked for hym to two of his men, the whiche ſayde that they had not ſeen hym ſith he was gone with them. And whan they hearde that: they were full ſory and went agayne to theyr brother Reynawde and tolde him howe they coulde not fynde hym. Whan Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde vnderſtoode that they hadde not founde hym, he beganne to make more ſorowe than yf all his brethern had be deade, and than who had ſeen the greate mone that Alarde, Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde and the lytyll Richarde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for theyr coſyn: he wolde haue had greate pitie for to ſee theym, for they pulled theyr heres from theyr heades and ſcratched theyr viſages, whan the good lady ſawe the greate ſorowe that Reinawde her huſbande and his bretherne made, ſhe fell downe in a ſwoune to the erth. I promyſe you he that had ſeen that ſorowe (how heard hearted that he were coulde) not haue kept him from weepyng.</p>
            <p>AFter that Reynawde hadde thus made greate ſorowe: he refrained himſelfe a lytyll and than ſayd.

My Lordes I pray you that ye leue your ſorowe, for by no ſorowe the matter can not be remedyed, I praye you recomforte yourſelfe, for I wyll put me agayne to the waye for to goe to the woode of the ſerpent for to ſpeake with the abbot of ſaynte Lazare to wyt yf he canne tell vs anye tydinges, for my hearte iudgeth me that afore .xxiiii. houres I ſhall knowe the certentie, and fare well my bretherne tyll I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me againe, ye ſpeake well and wiſely ſaide Alarde, but we ſhall goe with you for to keep you.

Syr ſaid the laddes the kynge is well me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye and maketh good chere, &amp; he hath forgoten all the ſorowe that he dyd make for your mayſter Rypus. For men haue brought to him Mawgys that he hated ſo muche. Now tell me ſaide Reinawde is Mawgis deade? Syr ſaide the two laddes he is yet a liue.

            <p>IN this party ſheweth the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye that whan Charlemaine ſaw him ſeaſed of Mawgis: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Rowland, Olyuer, Ogier the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the biſhop Turpyn, Richarde of Normandy, Guidellon of Bauier &amp; the Duke Naimes and ſaid to them, My lordes I pray you as muche as I can that ye doo make a greate ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, for I am delybered that afore ſupper Mawgys the great theef ſhal be hanged by the necke, for yf all the worlde had ſworne the contrary: yet ſhall I not keep him to the day were come. Syr ſaide the duke Naymes ſyth that it pleaſe you that Mawgis ſhall dye: ye ſhall make hym dye by a nother maner of wyſe, if ye doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me. And how than ſayde Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne? Syr I counſeyll you that ye hange not Mawgis by nyght: for Reinawde and his bretherne ſhould mocke you, and they ſhall ſaye that ye durſt not make him dye by daye light for feare of theym, and therfore ſyr abide till the day become, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maye ye doo execucion vpon hym with worſhyp. And whan the tyme ſhall become that ye wyll ſende him forth: ſend many folke with him, that and Reinawde and his brethern co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me there for to ſuccure him: that thei may be take, and hanged with hym, Naymes ſayde the kinge, ye mocke with me, for yf this theefe ſcape me: I am defamed. Syr ſayde Mawgis, if ye be a feard that I ſhould goe awai I ſhall giue you ſuretye that I ſhall not goe. Who is that ſaide Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn that ſhal be thy ſurety? is there
<pb facs="tcp:7017:112"/> nye man in the world that is ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that dare take this? Syr, ſaide Mawgis I ſhal finde ynoughe yf it pleaſe you. Nowe ſhall we ſee ſaide Charlemain how ye ſhal finde them, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mawgis looked about him, &amp; ſaw the twelue peeres: ſo called he Olyuer and ſaid to hym. Syr Oly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ye promyſed me whan I yeelded me to you that ye wolde helpe me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Charlemayne. Now I require you that ye wyll be my ſuretye yf it pleaſe you, wyth a good wyll ſayde Oliuer vpon my life and my goodes I ſhalbe your ſurery, and ye ſir Row<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land, ſaide Mawgis ſhall ye not be alſo for god my ſurety? and ye duke Naymes, and ye Ogier, and ye Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couf, and ye byſhop Turpyn, and ye damp Richarde of Normandye, and ye Guydellon of Bauyere, I praye you all that ye will be my ſurety for the loue of the good knight Reinawd Mawgys ſaid than the duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, will ye promyſe to vs vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your faithe that ye ſhall not goe from vs without our leaue? ye ſaid Mawgis vpon my faith. And than came the duke Naymes, with the other peeres of Fraunce before the kyng Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and ſaid to hym. Sir we wil be ſuretie for Mawgys vpon our ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues &amp; vpon our landes that we holde of you that he ſhall not goe a waye without your leaue, &amp; alſo of al your company, and we ſhall deliuer hym agayne to you to morow in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge for to doo with hym what ye wyll. My lordes ſaide the king ſith that ye wyll be his ſuretie: I remyſe him in to your keepynge, by ſuche a condicyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that I haue him to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the morning erly: ye ſhal leeſe all your londes. And ye ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer maye returne in to douce fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce again. Sir ſaid Oliuer we graunt it as ye haue ſayd. Lordes ſayde the duke Naymes ſith that this is doon: lette vs goe recomforte Mawgys, for he is well ſory. Lordes ſayd than Mawgis to them againe. Sith that ye haue doon me one good turne: doo me a nother. I pray you get me ſome meate, for I am yl a hungred. Whan Charlemayne vnderſtoode Mawgis ſpeake: he looked vpon hym, and ſaid all laughinge. And ſhalte thou eate ſayde Charlemaine? yea, ſaid Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis if I can haue any meate. Nowe heare ſaid Charlemaine, what it is of this deuil heere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aſketh for meate and ſo lytell a terme he hath to lyue. For &amp; I were in his plyght: I ſhould not nowe haue courage for to eate. Syr ſayd the duke Naymes ye ſaye yll, for who hath eaten well: he is the better at his eaſe wherof I pray you that ye let him haue ſome meat. And thenne the kinge waſhed his handes for to goe to ſoupper and ſaid, where ſhall Mawgis be for to eate? ſyr ſaid Rowlande, he ſhall well be by you. Neuewe ſaid the king ye ſaie ryghte well, for heere ſhal we be ſure of him and I hadde thoughte for to doo ſo. For I ſhoulde not date truſt hym to none other man. And than the kinge was ſette at the table, and he made Mawgys to ſyt nexte hym, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hym at the table, for as longe as the ſupper laſted: he durſte not eate nor drynke, leaſt that Mawgys
<pb n="cvii" facs="tcp:7017:112"/> ſhoulde werke wytche crafte vpon him, but Mawgis eate ryghte wel, for he had a good appetit to his meat. And whan Oliuer ſawe that: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to lawghe and ſhewed Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and after ſaide to hym. Haue ye ſeen how the king durſte not eate all this ſupper, for feare that maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys ſhould werke wytchecraft vpon hym. Surely ſayde Rowlande, it is true. After ſupper Charlemaine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſtuarde, and ſayde to hym, ſtuwarde I praye you brynge me .xl. torches, and that they brenne all the nyghte. Syr ſayde the ſtuarde, I ſhal doo your commaundement. And whan Charlemayne hadde ordeined this: he retourned him toward Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and ſayd to him. Fayre neuew I pray you that ye and Olyuer and al the twelue peeres of Fraunce that ye wyll watche to nyghte with me, for to keep this theef Mawgys, and make an hundred men to be armed, that ſhall watch with vs and make the play at the tables and at the cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to thende that none of vs falle a ſleepe, and alſo make a thouſand kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes to make good watch wythout to the ende that yf Mawgys ſhould eſcape vs: thei ſhould take him aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. And whan Charlemayne hadde ordeyned this: he ſet him downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bedde, and he made Mawgis to ſit downe by hym. And of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte Rowlande, Olyuer, Ogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Dane, and all the twelue pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res rounde aboute the bedde. Syr ſayde then Mawgys, where ſhal I ſleep. What ſay ye ſaid Charlemain wyll ye ſlepe? yea, ſayde Mawgys full fayne, if pleaſe you to ſuffre me. By my ſoule ſayde Charlemayne ye ſhall haue euyll reſte heere, for ye ſhall not ſleep as longe as ye be a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. For ye ſhal be hanged to morow-at the ſpryngynge of the daye. Syr ſayde Mawgis, ye doo me greate wronge. Wherfore haue I giuen you ſuretie, but only that I may haue my eaſe for ſo longe as I haue for to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. Other ſuffre me to take my reſte and that I may ſlepe: or elles holde quite my ſuretees, certes falſe theefe ſaide Charlemaine, all this ſhal not auayl thee. For I wyll that thy ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties goe quite, and diſcharged. But therfore ye be not out of my handes. And than he made to be broughte a greate payre of yrens, and fetted him with them bothe hys feete togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And made the cheyn to be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned harde at a piller, and with all he gaue him a greate coler of yron a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute his necke, wherof the kynge kepte the key himſelfe. And whan Mawgis was arraied of this facio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Charlemaine ſaide to him. By my ſoule Mawgis ye ſhall not eſcape me now. Sir ſaid Mawis, ye mock well with me. But I tell you nowe before the .xii. peeres of Fraunce that I ſhall ſee Mountawban or it be to morowe prime.</p>
            <p>WHan Charlemayne vnderſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de this that Mawgys ſaide to him: he trowed to haue wexed madde all quicke. So he
<pb facs="tcp:7017:113"/> ſtood vp and ſet hande to hys ſwerd, and came vnto Mawgys all wrothe for to haue ſmiten of his heade. But whan Rowland ſawe that: he auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hym and ſayde to the kinge. Syr for God mercy, for yf ye ſlewe him: we been all ſhamed for euermore, ſyr ye ought not to take heed to that he ſayth to you. For that, that he ſayth he ſaithe it like a man that is in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyre. And howe might that be that he ſhoulde eſcape you as ye hold hym now? Verely my neuewe I wote not how, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he heere afore tyme hathe ſo often mocked me, maketh me to doubte of him, but at all auenture I ſhall leaue hym in peace tyll to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe that he ſhall be hanged. Syr ſayd Rowlande, ye ſaye well. Than all they that were there beganne to playe at the tables and at the cheſſe, and many other games. And whan it came that they had played longe: they began all to haue greate luſte to ſlepe. And whan Mawgis ſaw that: he made his charme. And whan he hadde made it: they beganne all to fall in a ſtronge ſlepe, and Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine hym ſelfe ſlepte ſo harde, that he fell backewarde vpon hys bed. And whan Mawgys ſawe that Charlemayne was ſo faſt a ſlepe: &amp; all the twelue peeres of Fraunce and all the company of them: he beganne to make a nother charme, that was of ſuche vertue that his feters that were on his feete, &amp; the coler and the cheyne of yren fell all to the grounde a ſundre. And thenne Mawgys roſe vpon his feete, and ſaw Charlemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that ſlept ſo wel grouelynge with his head a wrye, and he tooke then a pelow &amp; righted vp his heade with all. And then he vngirded him and tooke Ioyous his ſwerde, and gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about him, and then after he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Rowland and tooke from him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randal his good ſwerde, and after he tooke Hauteclere from Oliuer and Cortyn from Ogier. And after thys: he went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coffres, and tooke there out all the treaſour of Charlemayne and went with all this ſtreyght to Mountawban. And whan Mawgis had taken all this: he tooke an herbe and rubbed Charlemaynes noſe and his lippes with it, and vnhoſed hym and after he ſhoued him wyth the fynger, and ſayde to hym, awake ſir emperoure, I promyſed you yeſter ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght that I ſhould not goe wythout I ſhould take my leue of you, farewell I goe now. And whan he had ſayde this: he went out of the pauilion, and ſet him to the way towarde Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban. And whan Charlemayne vnderſtoode that Mawgys had ſaid to him: he roſe vpon hys feete ſo wrothe that menne could be no more, and called vpon hys twelue peeres that he coulde not awake. And whan he ſawe that: he bethought hymſelfe an herbe that he had broughte wyth hym from beyonde the greate ſea, and tooke it and rubbed withall the noſe the mouth and the eien of Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, and in like wiſe to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther .xii. peeres of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent they were awaked, and roſe vpon their feete ſore abaſhed. &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were all awaked: they beganne to looke the one vpon the other. And
<pb n="cviii" facs="tcp:7017:113"/> the firſt that began to ſpeke: was the duke Naymes that ſayde to the king where is mawgies? By my ſoule ſayd Charlemayne, ye ſhall delyuer him me agayne, for ye haue let hym goe wilfully, For yf ye wolde haue ſuffred me to haue hanged him yeſter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day: I had be otherwyſe ryd of hym. Rowlande ſaid Olyuer, ſawe ye him goe hens? Naye by ſaynt Denys ſaid Rowland. I ſaw him wel goe ſaide Charlemaine. Syr ſaid Rowland ye ought thenne to haue tolde vs of it, for he ſhoulde not haue eſcaped ſo. And in ſaying this: Rowland loketh at his ſide, and he ſawe not durandal his ſwerde, wherof he did caſt a great ſighe. And than Charlemayne ſayde to him. Neuew where is your ſwerd? by my head I know well that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> theef Mawgis hath be wytched vs. For none of vs hath his ſwerde, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he hath my hoſen with him. Nowe hath he well mocked vs.</p>
            <p>ANd whan the .xii. peeres of fraunce ſaw that thei had loſt al their good ſwerds: they were right ſory for it more than any man canne ſaye. And after Rowland ſayde, by my faythe Mawgis hath wonne a great gayne, whan he bereth away thus our ſwerdes, for they ben more worthe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is all Paris. And whan Charlemayne perceyued that his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were open: he went anon &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in, &amp; he was ſore an angred wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he founde not his Crowne, nor the beſt parte of hys treaſoure, wherof he made great ſorow, and after ſayd, Ha falſe theefe Mawgis full litle I haue goten of thee &amp; of thy takynge. And who than had ſeen the ſorowe that the .xii. peeres of Fraunce made: wolde haue had no luſte to lawghe.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Nowe ſhall we tell you a lytell of Mawgys that wente as faſt as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he coulde towarde Mountawban and he came to paſſe ouer the water of Bala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>con at that place where Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde was full heauy, and full of ſorowe, by cauſe he knew no tydin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Mawgys, but whan Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys had paſſed ouer the water: bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde ſmelled hym and begane to crye and came toward Mawgys, wolde Reinawde or no. And whan Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys ſawe Reinawde: he knewe hym well, and ſaide to him lawghinge.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Charlemaine. By my faythe ſaide Mawgis, ye forgate me well behinde. Coſyn ſaide Reynawd, by my ſoule I coulde not doe therto. For I haue be heere ſyth yeſter day euyn. And I promyſe you that I was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered for to haue ſuccoured you or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to haue dyed with you.

Coſyn ſaid Reinawde ye haue wroughte well god gramercye, but of the ſwerde of Ogyer me diſpleaſeth. Coſyn ſayde Mawgis I haue doon it all wilfully to the end that the king ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke therby none euil, and that he were not a peched of treaſon. And than he ſhewed him al the cauſe and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Charlemayn had holde him. Coſin ſaide Reynawde ye did ryghte well. And whan he had ſayde thys: they went on their waye towarde Mountawban, and they mette in their waye Alarde, Guicharde and the lytil Richarde that came ridinge makinge greate mone for doubte of Reinawde. And whan Reinawde ſawe theim come: he ſaide to them, whether goe you my fayre brethern? Sir ſaide they we went ſeekinge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, ye haue founde me ſaid Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, and I haue founde our coſin Mawgis. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vnderſtood this tydinges: they were righte gladde and thanked oure lorde of it. And after Alarde ſaide to Mawgis Faire coſin where became ye that ye came not with vs again. Alard ſaid Mawgys, whan Richarde was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within the pauillion of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and had take the egle of golde: I taried in the pauillion for to ſlea Charlemaine, and it lacked but litill that I ſlewe him, and whan I trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to haue comen after you. I founde a greate rowte of knightes, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted me, and ſo I defended me of all my power. And than came Oliuer of Vyenne that ouerthrewe me dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and I yeelded me to him for his priſoner, the whiche deliuered me to Charlemayne that wolde haue made me to be hanged ſhamefullye but lorde I thanke you, I haue doon ſo muche that I am eſcaped. Coſin ſaid Alarde, it is well happed to you, whan thei had deuiſed longe ynough: they went to Mountawban, where they made greate feaſt, whan they were come there: it is not to be aſked if the good lady clare was wel glad, For incootinente ſhe did to be made ready diuerſe meates for the diner, &amp; whan they hadde eaten: they went to reſt, for they were wery and ſpecially Reynawde and Mawgis, wold faine haue ſlept. And the nexte daie they went to heare their Maſſe at the chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Mountawban, and whan the maſſe was doone: Reinawde called Mawgis his coſin and his brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and ſaide to them.

And than he tooke the egle that was of golde maſſi, and of precious ſtones and gaue it to Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde. And whan Reinawde ſaw that gifte ſo riche: he was gladde of it by cauſe of the great valure of it. Rei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawd called Mawgis &amp; ſaide to him Coſin what ſhall we doo with this egle? My coſin ſaide Mawgis me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that ye ought to put hym aboue vpon the apple of the greate towre of this caſtell to the ende that Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne and all his hoſte maye ſee it. By my ſoule ſaid Reinawdeye, ſaie wel. And they tooke the egle and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de it to be borne vpon the highe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of Mountawban. And whan the ſonne dyd ſhyne vpon thys Egle: it

            <p>WHan Charlemayne the greate Emperoure ſaw that the foure ſonnes of Aymon mocked him thus: he called to him Rowland and Olyuer, and all the other Peeres of Fraunce and ſayde to them. Lordes it is ſore miſhapped to vs ſith we ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in this londe of Gaſcoygn, for I haue loſt my crowne and Ioious my ſwerde &amp; myn egle of golde that was of ſo great value as ye all know, and ye al haue loſte youre good ſwerdes, where of we be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel ſhamed, &amp; alſo we haue ben chaſed fro the feeld ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.

By my ſoule ſayd the king I ſhall rewarde thee for it ryght well, but keep well that ye ſhew not this to no man vpon thy life, for I ſhall put therto a good remedy. And than he behelde aboute hym and ſaw Oliuer and ſayde, Olyuer inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and without any deſaye, take two hundred knyghtes with horſes and wel armed, and lede them at the ryuer ſyde of Balancon, where yee ſhall fynde Reynawde and Alarde, &amp; ſee that ye take them &amp; bring them hither, and if ye doo this: aſke of me what ye wyll, &amp; ye ſhall haue it.

And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had doone ſo: he ſpurred his horſe and went to Mountawba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the other. where as he myght well goe without to be vnbraied for it, for he was one of the ſuretyes of Reynawde as yee haue heard. And whan Charlemaine ſaw this: he folowed him vnto the gates And whan he was come to the gate of Mountawban: he began to crye with an hie voyce. By god Reynawde this that ye haue doone: ſhall auayle you litle, for ye ſhall neuer haue pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce wyth me as longe as I am man a liue. And whan that he had ſayd this he returned him from the gate, and ſayd to Oliuer that was there with hym. Oliuer go lightlye to Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendell, and bring heere all my hoſte for I wyll beſiege all thys Caſtell. Than ſayd Oliuer I ſhall go there with a good wyll, but and it pleaſe you ye ſhall come wyth me, for I promiſe you if ye comnot there your ſelfe: they ſhall not come hither for me. Than ſhall I goe there my ſelf, and thus tooke Charlemayne hys waye towarde Mountbendel where his hoſte laye, whan his folke ſawe him come: they wente agaynſt hym and began to ſaye to him, ſyr what haue ye doone with Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? lordes ſayd Charlemayne Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is gone to Mountawban, but I commaund you al that incontinent without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laye that my ſiege be tranſported all rounde aboute Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban, and ye damp Oliuer ſhall beare the orifla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and damp Rychard of Normandye ſhall lede our hoſte. Whan Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne had comau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded all this: there was none that ſayde agaynſt it, but ſet themſelf to bring downe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and pauilion, and to truſſe and lede theyr baggages, and caryed all to Mountawban.</p>
            <p>RYcharde of Normandy went with .xii. thouſande men to Bala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>con, to keep the paſſage of the ryuer tyll all the hoſte were ouer the ryuer. This hanging: Charlemayne had put himſelf afore for to ſe where he might beſt pitche his tentes, and his pauilion, for to keep ſiege royall afore the Caſtell of Mountawban.</p>
            <p>And whan al the hoſte was come a fore Mountawban: the kinge made incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his pauilion to be ſet vp before the great gate. And whan all the hoſte was ſet: the nyght watche of the great Towre came to Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys, and ſayde vnto him. Syr wyt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Charlemaine is come with his hoſte and hath put his pauilion before the mayſter gate. Is it true ſayd Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis? yea without any faute ſayd the watche. Now care not for it ſayde Mawgis, for Charlemayne ſeeketh his domage, and he ſhall haue it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than he weeneth. Than went Mawgys to Reynawde. And ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him howe Charlemayne was come with all his hoſte. And whan Reynawde heard this: he went vnto Rowland and ſayd vnto him. Sir ye muſte wyt that Charlemane youre vnkle hath layde ſiege afore vs, but I promiſe you that if it were not for the loue of you: I ſhould ſhew him

Reynawde (ſayd Rowlande) I thanke you mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, but one thynge I wyll tell you, ſaue your correccion, me ſemeth that I ought to ſende to myne vnkle the duke Naymes, Ogyer the dane, and alſo the byſſhop Turpyn that ſhall ſhewe vnto him in this maner, Syr Emperour wyt that Reynawde for the loue of you wyll not gyue no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons to your neuew, nor he wyl not put hym in priſon. But he maketh him as good cheere as he doth to his owne ſelfe. And that more is, Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, his brethern and Mawgys doo preſent themſelfe for to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and theyr caſtell vnto your handes, ſo that theyr liues be ſaued. ye ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke well and wiſely ſyr Rowland ſaid Reynawde, and ſo I am redy to doo as ye wyll haue it. Rowland ſayde the duke Naymes, I dare not goe to hym, ye may wel ynoughe ſayd Row<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land. For ye be not hated of the king duke Naymes ſayd Ogyer, we ſhal goe to Charlemayne, yf ye wyll doo after me. And they accorded that thei two ſhould goe togither to the kyng for to ſhew to hym as Rowland had deuiſed. And whan that theſe two princes, the duke Naymes and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyer came to the pauilion of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne: they ſaluted him reuerently, and the duke Naymes ſpake to him in thys maner of wyſe. Syr Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour your neuew Rowland recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth him humblye to your good grace, the whych Reynawde kepeth within Mountawban for his priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not vnkyndly: but he maketh to hym as good there and as great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he bereth vnto hym as he were his owne brother, and his ſouerayn lorde, and all this he dooth for your loue. And demaundeth of you peace yf it pleaſe you to graunt it to hym by ſuche maner that he ſhall gyue you Mountawban, and the Egle of golde, and he ſhall let goe Rowlande at his libertie without raunſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And alſo he ſhall yeelde hymſelfe to you and his brethern in lyke wyſe, and alſo Mawgys for to doo your wyl with them, ſaue theyr liues: and they ſhall promyſe you yf theyr ſeruyſe pleaſeth you, that thei ſhal ſerue you agaynſt all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with all theyr power and puiſſaunce, ſo that ye ſhall haue cauſe to thanke them for it.</p>
            <p>WHa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charlemayne vnderſtood theſe wordes: he ſhooke al for great angre. And began to ſaye to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naymes, and to the other that were come to hym, flee out of my pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uilion euill folke. I meruayle me how haue ye durſt cum heere within and I tell you that Reynawde ſhall haue no peace with me, but if I haue Mawgis for to doo my wyll of him. whan the barons vnderſtode char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne that ſpake thus: they came out of hys Pauilion and tooke no leaue at hym, but returned inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to Mountawban. whan they were come there: Rowland and Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde aſked theym howe they had doone w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Charlemaine? Lordes ſaid the duke Naimes, it is no force to be aſked after it. For Charlemayn wyl not doo it, but if men take vnto him Mawgis for to doo his will of him, Lordes ſayd Reynawde I am ſorye for it. I meruayle how Charlemayn
<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:7017:121"/> is ſo harde harted, and I make mine a vowe vnto god, he ſhall not haue Mawgys though I ſhould dye for it. After theſe wordes: they went to theyr meat, &amp; Mawgis made theym to be ſerued ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teouſly and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and whan they had ſupped: the beddes were heled, and they wente anon to bed. And whan Reynawde wolde go to his bed: he called to hym Mawgis, and ſayd to hym, coſyn I pray you that ye doo make good wat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che to night. For ye know that oure liues lieth therupon. Syr ſayd maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gis feare not for to ſlepe well &amp; reſt your ſelfe. For I promyſe you y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> thys caſtell ſhalbe well kepte by goddes grace, &amp; whan all the barons were a bed: Mawgis wente to the ſtable and ſadled Bayarde, and than he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghted vpon hym and he came to the gate and ſayd to the porter.

And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was come there: he began for to make hys charme, &amp; brought a ſlepe all they that were in the hoſte. And whan he had doone ſo: he wente to the bed of Charlemayne, and tooke hym in his armes and brought him vpon Bayarde. And whan he had doone ſo: he wente his wayes agayn to Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban, and brought Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne with him. And whan he was come there agayne: he tooke Charlemayne from Bayarde, and bare him into his chambre and layde hym in his bed. Whan all this was thus doone: He tooke a torche &amp; fired it, and pytched it bytwene the ſtrawe &amp; the bedſted, ſo that it helde faſt euin before the viſage of the kinge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne. And after he wente to the chambre of Reynawde and ſayde to hym, Coſin what wolde ye wel giue that ſhould deliuer Charlemayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your handes? By my ſoule ſayde Reynawde I haue nothyng but that I ſhould gladly giue it ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I might haue him heere within this caſtell of Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban. Coſyn ſayd Mawgis wil ye promyſe me that ye ſhall doo to him no harme of his body, nother your brethern nor none of yours? &amp; I ſhall put him into your handes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen anon. Coſyn ſayd Reynawde, I promyſe you that vpon my faythe, now come with me ſayd Mawgys. And than Mawgys brought Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde into his chambre, and ſhewed him Charlemayne that was in hys bed and ſlepte, and after he ſayde to him. My coſyn Reynawde. Now ye haue heere Charlemayne, keep him ſo well that he ſcape not you. And whan Mawgis had deliuered Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemayne to Reynawde, he came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtable where he had put bayarde and tooke ſome ſtrawe and rubbed his backe with all &amp; his head, &amp; than he kiſſed him al weeping, and tooke leaue of him. And after he went and tooke the palſtar and the cloke and came vnto the porter, and gaue him all his other raymentes, that he had wered afore and went out of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban. ¶ Now leaueth the hiſtory to ſpeke of Reynawde, and of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne a lytle, and ſhall ſhewe of Mawgys that left all his kinred &amp;

For after he were dead: ther is no man in all Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould feare any thynge. whan Reynawde vnderſtode the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell that Richarde his brother had giuen him: he looked downe towarde the erthe, and bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thinke ſore. And whan Rycharde ſaw him muſe ſo: he aſked him what he thought &amp; yf he cared who ſhould doo execucion vpon the kynge? for ſayd Rycharde ye ſhall not lacke for that: for none other ſhal hange him but my ſelfe, and that I ſhall doo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen anon yf ye wyl deliuer him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. After theſe wordes: Reynawd ryghted his head vp and ſayde. My brethern ye know well that Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine is our ſouerayne lorde. And of thother part ye ſee how Rowland the Duke Naymes, Ogier the dane, the biſſhop Turpin and alſo Eſcouf the ſonne of Oedon are wythin for to make our poyntment with Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne, for they know well that we ben in the right &amp; the king in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and thus yf we kyll hym: be it wyth ryght or with wronge, all the worlde ſhould renne vpon vs, nor neuer as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge as we liue: we ſhal not be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out warre. And whan Reynawde had ſayde thys: Alarde ſpake in thys maner. Brother ye haue ſpoken wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelye, but ye ſee that we cannot haue peace wyth Charlemayne by no wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe me ſemeth that wee ought to aſke it of hym oute for all, and yf he wil not: let vs keep hym pryſoner, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayd Guycharde ye ſay wel, but my hert telleth me that he ſhall neuer make peace wyth vs nor loue vs, Lordes ſayde Rycharde me ſemeth that wee haue a good head of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde our brother, thanked be our Lorde, the whyche hath gouerned vs ryght well herto, let hym ſhyfte wyth the kynge as he wyll. And that that he wil: ſhall be doone. By my faythe ſayde Alarde, Rycharde ſpeaketh well. And whan they were all accorded to that that Reynawde ſhould doo: the foure brethern went to the Chambre where Rowlande was, to whome Reynawde ſpake in thys wyſe. Syr Rowlande a ryſe I praye you that ye wyll ſende for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier, the byſſhop Turpyn and for all the other that be heere wythin of the folke of Charlemayne. For I wyll tell you one thynge. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande ſaw Reynawde and hys bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern at that time of the night come into his chambre: he was meruayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Neuertheleſſe he ſent for all hys felawes, as Reynawde hadde tolde hym. And whan they were al come: Reynawde ſtoode vp and ſayd. Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ye ben all my freendes, god gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy and you, wherof I wyll not hyde nothynge from you. Yee muſt know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue heere within a pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by whome I ſhal haue peace &amp; all myne herytaunce agayne. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſayd Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, I pray you tel me what he his. For heere is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that wolde fayne ye ſhould doo wel. By my ſoule ſayd Reynawde it is the great emperour Charlemayn
<pb n="cxviii" facs="tcp:7017:123"/> to whome al frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce belongeth. And whan Rowland vnderſtode theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges: he was ſore maruayled of it &amp; ſayd. Reynawde ye tell me nowe a wunderfull thynge, Howe haue ye taken myne vncle ſo lyghtly? tell me &amp; it pleaſe you, how ye had him heere within? haue ye taken hym by force of armes? nay verely ſaid Reynawd Tell me then how I pray you ſayd Rowlande? wit it ſayde Reynawde that I wot not howe Mawgys my coſyn did to night, but well I wot y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath brought the king heere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in out of his pauilion, and hath laide him in a bed, in a chambre where he is now faſt a ſlepe.</p>
            <p>WHan Rowland and al his felawes heard theſe tidin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: they were greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſhed, how it myght be that maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his ſhould bringe the kynge there. I meruayle much ther of ſayd the duke Naymes, for ye knowe well that the king made hymſelfe for to be kepte bothe night and day well ſure. Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſayde than Ogyer, all this hath doone our Lorde for the loue of rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, bycauſe he ſetteth hym al to miſcheif againſt Reynawde and that the warre hath laſted to longe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſhal now be left, wherof I tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke God for my parte. For manye good knightes haue loſte their lyues for it. And whan Ogier had ſayd thus: Reynawde tooke Rowland and the other, and brought theym alwayes ſpeakinge vnto the chambre, where Charlemayne laye ſo faſte a ſlepe, that they coulde not awake hym, for nothing that they could doo to him, For Mawgys had charmed hym ſo harde. And whan the barons ſawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinge ſo harde a ſlepe: they wundred full ſore vpon it, &amp; they were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abaſſhed of it. Than ſpake Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fyrſt and ſayde Reynawde where is Mawgis that hath wrought ſo well to night. I praye you let hym come heere, and that he awake mine vncle Charlemaine out of this ſlepe And whan he ſhall be awaked: wee ſhall all fall at hys feete, and ſhall crye hym mercy. And ſo I pray you that thoughe yf ye holde mine vncle in your handes, that ye wyll not be the prouder for it in youre wordes, by my fayth ſyr Rowland ſayd Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde. I wil that ye know I ſhould rather dye than I ſhould ſay ſo my ſouerayne lorde a foule worde. But I ſhall put me, my goodes, and all my brethern to his wyll, to the ende that it wyl pleaſe hym to graunt vs peace wyth him. And I wyll go fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Mawgys to you, therto doo with hym what ye wyll. And than Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde wente and ſought Mawgys the whiche he coulde not finde, wher of he was full ſory. And whan that the porter wyſt that Reynawde ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght after Mawgys: he came to hym and ſayd. Syr ye ſeeke hym for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght, for he wente his wayes out ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght now. And how knoweſt thou of it ſayd Reynawde? Syr wyt it that this night he made me open the gate and he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your horſe bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde. And he had not taryed longe: whan he brought a great man a big<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge vpon the horſe necke afore hym, &amp; went in I wot not where. And ſoone after he came agayne vpon another
<pb facs="tcp:7017:124"/> horſe, and he had clothed hym ſelfe poorely. And than he made me to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gate, and he wente oute, and he came not ſith againe. And al this is trouth that I tell you now.</p>
            <p>ANd whan Reynawde had vnderſtande theſe wordes he was ſo wrothe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wiſt not what to ſay nor doo. For he knewe well by hymſelf that Mawgys was gon his wayes bycauſe he wolde no len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger abyde the wrathe of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne. Than began Reynawde for to weepe full tenderly for hys coſin that was thus gone. And all wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge he came againe vnto the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſayde to them how Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys was gone away wythout his knowledge wher of he was ſo worth and ſo ſori that he went almoſte out of his minde. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alarde, Guy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>charde, and Rycharde had well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de thys: they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to make great moue, and ſorowed full ſore. And than Richarde began for to ſai, Ha my fayre coſyn Mawgys what ſhall we doo from hens forthon? ſith that we haue loſte you: we may wel ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be diſcomfited. For ye were our ſaluacyon, our ſuccours, &amp; oure hope, our counſel, our refute, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and alſo our guyde. For it is not yet longe ago that I ſhould haue dyed an euyll death yf I had not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuccoured through your helpe. Alas all the heuynes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye bere of the wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kinge Charlemayne hath agaynſt you cometh onli by vs. And whan he had ſayd ſo: he knacked his teeth for angre, and ſayde. wee ben nowe well all loſt ſyth that we haue loſt Mawgis. And with this: he ſet hande to his ſwearde, &amp; wolde haue ſlayne the Emperour Charlemayne but Reynawde drew him a ſyde. And the duke Naymes and Ogyer ſayde than vnto hym. Rycharde Richarde refrayne your courage. For it were not wel doone for to kyll a man that ſlepeth. And alſo afore that we ſhal departe hence: we ſhall ſet all at one and God wyll. ¶ Shortelye for to ſpeake: Olyuer and the Duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſpake ſo fayre vnto Rycharde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they made him promiſe them that he ſhould doo no harme to the Kynge Charlemayne. Neuertheleſſe Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde left not to make great ſorow for his coſyn Mawgys that he had loſt. For al them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaw him make ſo great mone had pitie for to ſe him. It was no meruayle if Richarde made ſorowe for Mawgis: For I promiſe you he had greate need of hym not longe after. And ſo had all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, as ye ſhall heare heere after.</p>
            <p>ALl thus as the foure ſonnes of Aymon made theyr moue for the loue of theyr coſin Mawgis: The duke Nymes began to ſpeake &amp; ſayde in this wiſe. By god, lordes ye doo not wel for to make ſo great ſorowe. I pray you leue this heuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And let vs begyn to ſpeake of your peace that muſte be made with the Emperour Charlemayn that an ende maye be hadde of thys warre, that hath endured ſo longe. By god ſayd Rowlande ye be paſſynge ſlow therupon. And alſo we muſte fyrſte
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:7017:124"/> haue his mercy or euer we moue any thing of the peace. For ye wot wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I left him bycauſe that peace ſhould be made. Syr ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naymes ye ſpeake wyſely and well, but howe ſhal we ſpeake wyth hym wythout Mawgys were heere? we cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake hym. And but yf god remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: we ſhal neuer ſpeke wyth him. But al thus as the barons ſpake in thys wyſe: The charme that Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys had ſet vpon Charlemayne was come at an ende, and the ſtrength of it was paſſed. And ſodenly Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine began to moue hys body, and aroſe anon vpon his feete, and right ſore abaſſhed looked al aboute him. And whan he ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was at mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubieccion of Reynawd the ſonne of Aymon: he was ſore an angred, and made ſuche ſorowe for it, ſo that al they that were there tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that he had ben mad and from hymſelfe. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wittes were come agayne: he knew wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys had doone it vnto hym &amp; ſware that as longe as he were manne on liue: he ſhould make no peace tyl that he were out of Mountawban, and that men had brought Mawgys to hym. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rycharde vnderſtode this that Charlemayne ſayd: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſaye in this wyſe. Howe the deuill dare ye thus ſpeake? ſyr ye ſee well that ye be our pryſoner. And yet ye threte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. I make to god mine a vowe and to Saynte Peter, were not that I haue promyſed, that I ſhal not doo to you no harme at this tyme: I ſhould ſtrike the head from the bodye of you. Holde your peaſe ſayd Reynawde, let the kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne ſaye his wyll, ye are ouer beſy in your wordes. And let vs all pray hym that he wyll pardon vs. For the warre hath laſted to longe, curſed be he that began it. For great euyles and harmes the whiche are happed therby.</p>
            <p>REynawde was wyſe, and wel taught for to ſtylle thus hys brethern, to whome he ſaid. My lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des my brethern, yf it pleaſe you, ye ſhal come with me, for to cry mercy vnto our ſouerayne lorde the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Charlemayne. Reynawde ſaid Alarde, we ſhall doo all that ye wyl. By mi faith ſaid the duke Naimes, My lordes ye doo ryght wiſely, and I promyſe you that all good ſhall come to you therof. Than Reynawd and all hys brethren, and Rowland and Oliuer, and Ogyer the Dane, the duke Naymes, the biſſhop Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, and Eſcoufe the ſonne of Oedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began all for to fall on theyr knees, before the emperour. And Reinawde ſpake fyrſte, and ſayd in this maner of wiſe. Noble Emperour haue mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy of vs, for I and my brethern wee yeeld vs to you to doo your pleaſure of vs, &amp; your will be ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our lyues ben ſaued: &amp; there is nothinge but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we will doo it for the loue of you if it pleaſe you to graunt vs peace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you. And for that piti &amp; pardon that God gaue vnto Mary Magdelene whan ſhe waſſhed hys feete in the houſe of Simeon, good ſyr haue pity of vs. And yf it pleaſe you not for to pardon me: at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt pardon my bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thern. And take them agayne theyr landes, and I ſhal gyue you Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:7017:125"/> and Bayarde my good horſe And ſo ſhall I goe into the holy la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de I &amp; Mawgis, where we ſhal ſerue to the Temple of our Lorde. And whan the kinge Charlemain heard Reynawde ſpeake thus: he blaſtred all for angre, and ſayd by that good lorde that made me, yf all the worlde ſpeake to me therof, yet ſhould I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer coſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me to no peace, but I haue Mawgys in my handes for to doo my wyll vpon hym. Alas ſayd than Reynawde, now haue I hearde that worde bytynge, wherof I am al deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. For I ſhould rather let my ſelfe be hanged, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente to the death of Mawgys my good coſyn. For he hath not deſerued towarde vs, that we ſhould betraye hym, but rather he were worthy by reaſon for to be lorde aboue vs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde ſayd tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charlemaine, thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke not thoughe I am your pryſoner y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſhall make me doo anye thynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt my wyll, ſyr ſayd Reynawd wyte it that myne entente is for to meke my ſelf toward you for I haue leuer that we ſuffre wronge of you, than ye of vs, now tell me ſyr how I ſhall delyuer you Mawgys that is our life, hope, ſucours, our comfort, ſheeld, our ſpere and alſo our ſwerde our brede, our wyne and our fleſſhe, alſo our refute, our mayſter our gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yde, and our defence in all places, wherby ſyr I tell you that yf ye had all my brethern in your pryſon, and that ye ſhould make them to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and that Mawgys were with in my power and with me: yet wold I not yeelde hym vnto you for to quyte wythall my brethern. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I ſwere you vpon my fayth that I wot not where that he is gone, god wot it. Ha ſayd the Emperour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne, goddes curſe haue he, for I am ſure he is heere within you, he is not ſayd Reynawde I take it vpon my baptyſme. And than Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde turned himſelf toward Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and all the other barons and ſayd to them.

And than Naymes that was kneelinge vpon his knees, and that heard that Reynawde had ſayd and wyſte well that he ſpake but well: ſayde to the Emperour in this wiſe, Syr I pray you that ye wyll not be dyſpleaſed of that I ſhall tell you, ye know ſyr y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am ſuretie for Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, and ſo is Ogyer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dane, but me ſemeth that we ought now to be diſcharged therof, ſith that ye be here preſente within his caſtell, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynge I wyll tel you, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that ye ought to take, that the erle Reynawde proffereth to you or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any more harme come to you ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo helpe me God ye ſhall doo wel. And al they of your courte ſhal be glad of it. And whan the barons hearde this that Naymes had ſayde to the kinge Charlemaine: they ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke all and ſayde. Syr doo that the duke Naymes hath tolde you, for he hath gyuen you good counſell and true. And yf ſo be that ye doo it not: ye ſhall come to late for to repente you of it.</p>
            <p>But
<pb n="Cxx" facs="tcp:7017:125"/> WHan Charlemayne vnderſtode this that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naimes had ſayd to him: he was ryght wroth of it. For his herte was ſo harde aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with great angre: that he tooke no hede of good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, and he ſware by ſaynt Denys of Fraunce that he ſhould not doo it for no man but yf he had fyrſt Mawgys in hys handes for to doo hys wyll ouer hym. And whan Reynawde hearde theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: he bluſtered in his face for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, and roſe vp from kneelinge his bretherne and all the other barons alſo. And then Reynawde ſayde to Rowlande and to all the other Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that were there. Syr I wyl wel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Charlemaine know my wil &amp; my entente, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche I ſhall ſhew afore hym vnto you.

For I ſhall ſeeke it in all the maners that a true knight ought to doo. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawde had ſayd this: he turned him towarde the kynge, and ſayd to hym. Syr ye maye goe hens whan it pleaſe you, for by my ſoule ye ſhal haue no harme of me now, for ye be my ſouerayne lorde, &amp; with good wil we ſhalbe in good peace wyth you.</p>
            <p>THe barons of frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there: wundred ſore of the great kindenes of Reynawde.

I wolde not haue trowed that he ſhould euer haue fared ſo fayre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Charlemayne. And whan Rychard vnderſtoode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, that his brother Rei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde had ſayde: he ſpake in thys wiſe, brother Reinawde I holde you mad. What wyll ye doo? ye ſee that we haue in our handes this vengea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kyng the whiche we may kyll or els ſuffre hym to lyue, &amp; yet he is ſet ſo ſore to pryde that he wyll doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that his good counſell telleth hym, but he threteneth vs alwayes more and more, and ye wil let him go thus a waye: ſurely brother if he ſca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peth vs ſo: he ſhal yet angre vs right ſore, and I promiſe you yf he hadde vs as we now haue hym: he ſhould make vs all to dye ſhamefullye, not al the golde in the worlde ſhould not ſaue vs therfro. And therfore I tell you that ye doo greate folye to let him go thus away. For and ye wyl, ye ſhall now make our peace, but me ſemeth, ye ſeeke none other but your death, wherof I pray god yf ye ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre him thus to goe awaye: that he maye make you to dye a ſhamefull death. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reynawd heard his brother ſpeke ſo: he was wroth &amp; ſayd to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in angre. Holde your peace bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther for he ſhall goe his wayes quite will you or no, and the peace ſhal be made whan he wyll and no ſoner it ſhal not be, for there vnto he ſhal not be compelled of me, and go you hens from me, for your great wordes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth me.</p>
            <p>WHan Reynawde had ſayde this: he dyd call a gentylman of hys to whome he ſayd, go lightly without any taryenge to the yoman of min horſes, &amp; byd him bringe me
<pb facs="tcp:7017:126"/> my horſe Bayarde. For I wyll that my ſouerayne lorde ryde vpon hym vnto his hoſte, for he rode neuer vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no better horſe. And whan Richarde heard this: he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro thens al ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge with angre as a fyerſfull lyon bycauſe he knew that Charlemayne ſhould goe ſo. And wit it that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Charlemayne hearde and vnderſtode well all theſe wordes, but he durſte not ſaye nothyng, ſo ſore he feared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fierſnes of the yong Richard.

And whan Charlemayn ſaw this he lighted anon vpon Bayarde &amp; went out of Mountawban for to goe to his hoſte, and Reynawde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed him to the gate of Mountaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, &amp; whan the kinge was gone: he made the gate to be ſhet anon. And the frenche men that ſawe their king come agayn: they were right gladde and receyued hym worthely, &amp; after they aſked hym how it we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with him and yf he had graunted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it is wel with me, God gramer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but of peace I haue made none nor neuer ſhall as longe as I am man a lyue for no man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal ſpeake to me of it, but yf I haue the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour mawgis for to doo with him mi wyll. Syr ſayd ſome of his barons how haue ye be delyuerd. By my fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th ſayd charlemayn, Reynawde hath delyuerde me agaynſt that the wyll of hys bretherne all quite at my ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.

            <p>ANd whan Reynawde ſawe bayarde, that Charlemayne had ſent hym agayne: he called row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and his felawes &amp; ſayd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fayre lordes I know well that ye be not in the grace of the greate kynge Charlemaine for the loue of me, but I wyll not that ye haue mawgre for me nor for my brethern, and therfore fayre lordes I quyte you all quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that I maye lay vpon you, and gyue you leue to goe whan it pleaſe you. And whan the Duke Naymes vnderſtode the kindnes of the hert of Reinawde that was ſo noble: he tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hym hyghly, and kyſſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſed hym for great loue, &amp; wolde haue kneeled downe afore hym, but Reynawde wolde not ſuffre hym.</p>
            <p>Than the duke Naymes began to ſaye, let vs thynke to goe after the kyng Charlemayne your vncle, ſith it pleaſe Reynawde to gyue vs leue Naymes ſayd Rowlande, how can we doo this, ſhall we leue Reynawde the whiche ye ſe myne vncle wyl dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye
<pb n="cxxi" facs="tcp:7017:126"/> wrongfully? Syr ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naymes heare me yf it pleaſe you. I counſel that we go hens, and whan we ſhal be afore Charlemayne: we ſhall aſke him how Reynawde dyd delyuer him, for yf we ſpeake to him of peace: he ſhalbe wrothe wyth vs; but whan he ſhal remembre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great goodnes and curteyſy of Reynawde his hert ſhalbe molified, &amp; it cannot be but he ſhal doo to him ſome grace and fauour, for he ſhall know well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his hert is ouer great, &amp; that he hath doone to Reynawde great wronge. Certes ſyr Naymes ſayd the barons ye ſpeake wyſely, and ye giue ryght good counſell. And whan they were accorded to the counſell of the Duke Naymes: Rowlande aſked after his horſe, and eche of the other barons alſo. And whan they were redye for to lyght on horſbacke: there came mi lady Clare the wyfe of Reynawde that kiſſed Rowlande, Olyuer and all the other barons, and after ſhe ſayde to them in this maner. Lordes that be heere preſent. I beſeche you in the name of god &amp; for his bleſſed paſſion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it pleaſeth you for to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace of my lorde Reynawde and ſemblably of hys bretherne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the great king Charlemayn, ye know my lordes that the kynge dothe to my lorde great wrong: and alſo ye know the great curteyſy and the kyndnes that my Lorde my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hath ſhewed vnto Charlemayn, and well ye wot that yf my Lorde had not be: hys brother Rycharde wolde haue ſtriked the head from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of hym. Madame ſayde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naymes doubt not. For and god be pleaſed the peace ſhalbe made with in theſe three dayes. And than they lighted al on horſbacke, and the three brethern of Reynawde conueyed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the gate, and Reynawde taryed after them vpon the brydge, &amp; whan they were come to the ſayde brydge Reynawde ſayd to them, My lordes I commende you to God. I maye no lenger goe with you, prayinge that ye wyl haue me in your reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Then al the Peeres of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (that were there) began to weepe tenderly and tooke their leaue of Reynawde the noble knyght, &amp; after they tooke theyr way towarde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoſte of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne. And whan the Emperour ſaw them come: he called to hym his barons and ſhewed them they that were comynge. And whan the baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſaw them: they meruayled greatly &amp; had greate feare, for they wyſte not what it was, but Ydellon the Erle ſaid, by god we haue recouered row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and hys felawes, yea ſayde Charlemain, godes curſe haue they. Thys hangyng: Rowland and hys felawes came tofore Charlemayne and lighted a foote, and incontinent they kneeled humbly afore the king and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duke Naymes began to ſpeake firſt and ſayd. Noble Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour wee are come in your preſence for to crye you mercy, beſeching you for God that it will pleaſe you to take vs vnto your good grace, for we haue doone nothing agaynſt you but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was for your wele. But ſith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue knowen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your wyl was not for to haue peace: we haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken Reynawde and all his brethern nor neuer whyle we ben a liue they
<pb facs="tcp:7017:127"/> ſhall haue no ſuccours of vs. Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſayde Charlemayne I pardon you, but I tell you yf we tary heere longe ſtil: we ſhal haue lytle gaynes therby, wherfore I pray you that we go aſſaute Mountawban bothe by day and bi night, by ſuch maner that he be taken of vs incontinent, &amp; they all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ben in it brought to death. Sir ſayd the duke Naymes ye ſay well, but and yf ony mifortune happeth to vs as it hath doone heere afore time: I promiſe you it ſhalbe to you great dommage, and me ſeemeth it were muche better to haue peace, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to contynewe the warre.</p>
            <p>ANd whan the Barons of Fraunce heard this, that the duke Naymes had ſayde to the king: they began to crye with a high voice Syr Emperour, we praye you that ye wyl doo this that Naymes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth you. For he gyueth you good counſell. Whan Charlemayne heard the crye that hys folke made to him: he came to the duke Naymes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was kneelyng afore hym, and tooke him vp, &amp; in lyke wyſe his neuewe Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande and all the other, and ſayde to them. My lordes ye knowe that I haue pardoned you with right good wyll, but I wyll well that ye know but yf ye keep yourſelf fro helpinge of my enemies mortal I ſhal angre you vpon your bodies. For I hate them ſo muche that yf I ſhould abide heere all my lyfe: I ſhal deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And wit it that Charlemayne was glad that he had recouered hys ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uew Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and his other Peeres how be it he made no ſemblaunte of it. And he ſayd yet agayne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhold neuer departe from hys ſyege tyll y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had taken Mountawban and all the foure ſonnes of Aimon, wherof he ſhall doo ſharpe Iuſtyce, &amp; ſhall doo brenne Mawgys y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tawban, for he feareth you ſo muche that he dare not abyde you, leaſt yee ſhould make him to be hanged, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dyd ſteale you ſo falſly oute of your hoſte. Ha god ſayde Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, whan ſhal I ſee that I haue him for to doo my wyll of hym? For than the Sonnes of Aymon ſhould ſoone be a greed with mee.</p>
            <p>THan whan the kyng Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne had deuyſed longe y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe: he gaue leaue to all hys ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons for to go agayne into theyr te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kynge ſaw them together within his pauilion, he was therof glad, &amp; ſpake to them thus. Lordes I haue beſyeged Mountawban as nere as ye ſee, and I am not dyſpoſed for to departe he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce nother for colde, for hete nor for hungre, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue taken hym by fyne force, the whiche thynge ſhall be lyghtly doone, for I am ſure that they ſhall want vytay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les wythin. And worſe is for theym: they haue loſte the traytoure Mawgys whiche was theyr hope and comforte. wherfore I ſaye that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not holde it longe againſt my power, whan the barons hearde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Charlemayne thretened Reynawde

Then ſpake the Duke Naimes and ſaid to the Emperour, Syr ye ſay that they of Mountaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban be dyſpurueyd of meate, and that ye ſhall not departe from the ſyege tyll that ye haue taken the caſtel and that is a thinge that ſhall be doone lightlye, but I promyſe you yf ye ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to their vittailles be doo: ye ſhall lye here lenger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye ween of, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſyr I beſeche you, that it wyll pleaſe you to beleue my counſeyll yf it ſemeth you good, fyrſte take heede to the curtoyſy that Reynawde hath doone to you, for ye wot well that if he had not be: his brother Richarde ſhoulde haue ſlayne you, al the golde in the worlde ſhould not haue ſaued you. Item thynke thenne alſo in the great mekenes that he hath alwaies ſhewed to you, alſo for the great truſt that he hathe had in you, he leued you his good horſe bayarde that hath no matche in all the world, ſyr yf ye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthynke well al, ye ſhall find that no manne dyd neuer to none other ſo greate curtoyſye as Reynawd hath doone to you, and of that other parte he and his bretherne ben ſuch knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as euery body knoweth. I ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to you ſyr by al hallowen that or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ye ſhal take Mountawban: Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and his brethern ſhall beare to you ſuche domage, wherof ye ſhal be wrothe. And yet ye ought well to take heed how we waſt and deſtroye the country and the feeldes and great good ye doo dyſpende, whiche for youre honoure were better to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed vpon the ſaraſins: than vpon the foure ſonnes of Aymon, for the ſaraſins been now in reſt makynge great ioy for the cauſe of this warre, and they doo well.

            <p>THe kinge Charlemain was ſore abaſhed, whan he hearde the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Naymes ſpeake ſo: and it moued his bloud ful ſore and became pale as a white cloth for the greate wrathe that he had at his heart, and caſted a ſyde his ſight angrely vpon the duke Naymes and ſayde to hym by great wrathe. Duke Naymes by the faith that I owe to that bleſſed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye that conceyued the ſonne of god in her virginitie, that if there be any man ſo hardy to ſpeake more to me of accorde to be made with the four ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aymon: I ſhal neuer loue him but I ſhal angre hym on his bodye. For I am not dyſpoſed to make pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with them for nothynge that can be ſayd, but I ſhal hange them what ſoeuer it coſte me or I departe from this ſyege. whan the barons hearde Charlemaine ſpeake thus proudely: they were ſore meruaylled of it, and left to talke of this matter. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ogier ſawe that al the barons held theym ſtylle: he began to ſaye to the kynge Charlemaine. Curſed be the houre that Reynawde ſuffred not Rycharde to ſmite of your heade, for ye had not thretned him ſo now. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charlemayn heard that Ogier

And whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemen hearde the commaundemente of the king: they made no tarying but went &amp; armed themſelfe, and whan they were al ready: they came in good ordenaunce, and broughte ladders &amp; other inſtrumentes with them for to ſaute withal the caſtell and engynes for to breake downe the walles, and preſented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before Charlemain for to accomplyſh his wyll.

            <p>ANd as ſoone as Reynawde ſaw his enemies come: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his brother Alarde, and ſayde to him.

Neuertheleſſe the frenſh men came neare and entred in to the dyches as hogges doone in a myre, and dreſſed vp their ladders to the walles. But wyt it that they of within the caſtel beganne to defende ſo ſtronglye with caſtinge of ſtones: that they domaged ſore the frenſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſo that many of them lay deade within the dyches.

And therfore he made the trompette to be blowen, to call his folke a backe with ſo greate angre that he was almoſte out of his mynde, and whan the frenſhmenne hearde blowe the retrete: they were glad, for they were ſhrewdly hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and I promyſe you that Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main left ſuch a company dead with in the diches that he longe after was full ſory for it.</p>
            <p>WHan Charlemayn and all hys folke were wythdrawen again: he beganne to ſweare Saynte Denys of fraunce that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer departe thence til he had famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reynawde &amp; his bretherne within the caſtel of Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban, &amp; than he

For Charlemaine wolde haue be glad therof for to ſaue his life, ye know that our coſin maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis broughte him not heere for none other cauſe to be our priſoner, but to the entent that we ſhould make our peace, but ye wold not take heed to it, whan we might haue had our wyll, and I promyſe you we ſhall not doo as we wolde.</p>
            <p>THe emperour Charlemain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode ſo longe at the ſiege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mountawban, that they that were within it had great need of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taylles, for he that had any meat: he hyd it incontinent, and ſo great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of vittailles was there within a while that men coulde get there no meat for golde nor for ſiluer, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other fell downe at grounde heere and there ſo feynt for hungre that it was great pitie for to ſee, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> derth was there ſo great that thone brother hidde his meat from the other, and the father from the childe, &amp; the childe fro the father &amp; fro the mother. And ſhortlye to ſpeake: I promiſe you that the poore folke died for hungre by the ſtreetes, and with this was ſo great ſtenche in Mountawban of the dead that were there: that no man coulde endure it, And whan Reynawd ſaw this he was ſorye for it, and than he dyd doo make &amp; greate charnell wher in he made all the deade bodyes to be buryed. And whan Richarde ſawe ſo greate mortalitie within the caſtel of Mountawban, throughe cauſe of the great dearth that was there, and ſaw his brother Reinawd in ſo great diſtreſſe: he could not forbeare, but he ſaied to him, by god my brother nowe goeth it worſe then euer it dyd, it had be muche better if ye hadde beleued me, for yf ye wolde haue ſuffred me to ſlea the kynge Charlemayne: we ſhoulde nowe not haue be in thys myſcheef and great pouertie that we haue nowe, nor your folke hadde not dyed for hungre as they doo, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he began to weep tenderly and ſayde Alas why doo I complayne other? I myght well complayne my ſelfe ſithe that I muſt dye and be put in to the charnell as the pooreſt of vs all. Ha Mawgis my fayre coſyn, where be ye now? ye faile vs at oure need, for and ye were here within with vs: we ſhoulde not be famyſhed for hungre and alſo we ſhould not doubte muche the kinge Charlemaine, for I wot well that ye ſhould get vs vitaylles ynough to lyue vpon for vs and our men, and now we muſte dye for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre as the wulf ſhould vpon a ſea. for Charlemaine hateth vs more than he dooth the ſaraſyns. And therfore
<pb facs="tcp:7017:129"/> it is not for vs to wayte after pitie of him, for he is ouer cruell a king vpon vs.</p>
            <p>CHarlemayne by the reporte of ſome folke knew the great det the &amp; ſcarſlie of vitailles that was within Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was right glad, &amp; called to him his folke and ſaid to them. Lordes now can not Reinawd eſcape, but he ſhal ſoon be taken &amp; hanged, &amp; the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Richard drawen at an horſe tayle, &amp; Alarde, &amp; Guichard alſo, and theyr worthines ſhall be litill worthe to them. And whan the kinge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine had ſayde theſe wordes: he ſent for all his peeres &amp; barons, and whan they were al come within his pauillion: he was glad of it and ſayd to them. Lordes thanked be god that I haue brought mountawban ſo low that Reinawde and hys knyghtes haue no more vitailles in it, and now they ſhal yeeld them ſelfe at my wyll mawgre their teeth, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte parte of their folkes ben deade for hungre, and yet dien dayly, and ye muſt wyt I wyl that Reynawde be hanged &amp; his brethern alſo, but firſt I wil that Rychard be drawen at an horſe tayl. And ſo I charg you that none of you be ſo hardye to moue my wyll to the contrary, for I will that it be doone as I ſaye. whan the duke Naimes Rowland, Oliuer, Ogier, the biſhop Turpin, &amp; eſcouf, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of Oedon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſpeke thus they were righte ſorye for the loue of Reinawd &amp; of his brethern, &amp; looked down &amp; ſaid no word at all for feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be ſhent of the king, &amp; Ogier with great payne kept his ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fro weepinge leſt Charlemaine ſhould not perceiue his ſorowful hert</p>

And whan Reinawde ſawe that there was no meat more: he wiſt not what he ſhould doo, for he was more ſory for his bretherne and for his wife, and his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than he was for him ſelfe, and began to ſaye in this wiſe. Alas what ſhal I doo? I am vanquiſhed &amp; ouercome with out any ſtroke.

            <p>HA faire ſonne ſaide Aimon, I can not helpe you for nothing, but goe your waye agayne, for I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue you forſworne ye wot it well, and therfore I wolde not doo ayenſt min othe, for all the good in the worlde, and my hearte is ryghte ſorye that I may not helpe nor gyue you ſuccour.

For I promyſe you if ye gyue vs no ſuccoures: that my wife, my children, my bretherne and my ſelfe ſhal die for rage of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre or euerthree daies ben paſſed. For it is all ready more then three dayes that none of vs eat any meat, and ſo I wot not what I ſhall doo. Alas ye be our father ſo ought you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs. For I wot well if the kinge haue vs: he ſhall make vs all to be hanged and dye ſhamefully.

My father for god haue pitie &amp; mercy vpon vs, and holde not your coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ayenſt your poore children, for it were great crueltie, and alſo ye know well that Charlemaine dooth to vs great wronge, for to perſecute vs as he dooth. whan Aymon hearde Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd ſpeake thus: he had greate pity of him, and was ſo ſory that almoſte he fell downe in a ſwoun to the erth and after he began to behold his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de Reynawd &amp; ſore wepinge he ſayde to him.

And whan Reinawd heard his father ſpeake ſo: he deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a foot &amp; kneled before him, &amp; ſaid an hundred gramercyes deare father and than he entred within the pauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of his father, and laded bayarde with bread &amp; with fleſh both fair and freſhe, and wyt it that bayarde dyd

And whan Reynawde had wel laded bayarde with vitailes: he tooke leaue of his father &amp; went a gayne to Mountawban, it is not to be aſked what welcome Reynawde had of his brethern, of his wife, and of his men, &amp; wyt it that whan they ſaw him bring ſo much vitailes: they ſwouned al for ioye to the earth, and whan Reinawd ſaw this: he wende they had ben dead for hungre. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan he to make great ſorow and not without a cauſe, and while that Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſorowed and made great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: his brethern began to come again to theymſelfe his wife and alſo hys two children. And whan Reinawd ſaw them al vpon their feet: he was glad and preſented to them meat for them and for hys folke, and they tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made great Ioy and eate their fill at theyr eaſe.

And on the morne whan the day was come: they roſe &amp; went to heare maſſe, and after the maſſe was doon they fell to their meate againe, and eat al that was left ouer euyn of that Reinawde had broughte, and whan the next night was come, Aimon (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> coulde not forget his children) made his ſtuarde to come before him and ſayde to him, ye know how I haue forſworn my children, wherof I am ſori that euer I did ſo. But it is ſaid that ar the need the frend is knowen, I let you wit that my children been yonder within in great pouertye and miſeaſe, and howe be it that I haue forſworn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I oughte nor maye not faile them, we haue three engyines that Charlemain hath made me doo make for to hurt my children wherof we haue domaged them as muche as we might, nowe muſt we helpe them after their domage. And I ſhall tell you, ſee that ye put within the engy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bread and fleſh both ſalt &amp; freſhe in great plenty in ſtead of ſtones, and let this be caſt in to the caſtell, for yf I ſhoulde die my ſelfe for hungre I ſhall not fayle theym as longe as: I haue wherof to helpe them, and alſo I repent me full ſore of the harm that I haue doon to them, for al the world ought to blame me therof with good ryghte, and we been in the wronge. Syr ſaide the ſtuarde ye ſaye well. For ye haue doone ſo muche ayenſte them that al the worlde blameth you therof, but incontinente I ſhall doo your commaundement. And than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtuard went and made the three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be filled with vittailles, and after he bad the gouerner to caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in to Mountawban. And ye muſte wyt that many of the hoſte blamed Aymon ſore, that he made hys en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynes to be caſte ayenſt hys chyldren for they wende it had be ſtones, and whan the nighte was paſſed &amp; that Reinawd was vp: he went heere and there within the caſtel, &amp; found foiſon of vittailes that his father had caſt, wherof he was right glad and ſayde Good lorde bleſſed be you, now ſee I wel that they that haue their truſt in you can not fare amis, &amp; than he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his brethern his wife &amp; his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſaid. My bretherne ye ſee howe our father hath pity of vs. And then he made the vittailles to be gathered
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:7017:132"/> vp and put in a ſure place, and ſo thei eate therof at their eaſe for they had well great need therof, for they were ſo ſore an hungred that it was greate pitie. And wyt it that Aymon made eaſte ſo muche vytayll within Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I know wel al thy wyles, thou mayſt not excuſe thiſelf, but by the faythe that I owe to God I ſhall auenge me ſo well or nyght: that if I may ye ſhal leeſe your heade for it. Sir ſaid the duke Aimon, I wil not denie it, for I tell you truely if ye ſhould make me dye or be brente in a fyre: I will not fayle my chyldren as longe as I maye helpe them. For my children be no theues traytours nor no murderers, but they been the moſt valiaunt knightes of the world &amp; the trueſt, &amp; ween not you to ſlea my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſuche maner, ye haue to longe wrought your foly yf it wolde ſuffiſe you. whan Charlemayne heard Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeake thus: he was angrye with it, &amp; for great wrath he loked as fire &amp; Almoſt he ſmote Aimon, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duke Naimes ſaw this: he auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Sir ſende home Aimon for ye haue kepte hym heere to lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, ye ought well to vnderſtande that Aymon wil not ſee his children to be dyſtroyed, and therfore ye ought not to blame him nor ſmite him, after that Charlemayne hearde the duke Naimes ſpeake: he ſayd to him. Nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſyth that ye haue iudged it: ye ſhall not be gaynſayd, &amp; than he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him towarde the duke Aymon &amp; ſayde to hym. Now goe forth out of myn hoſte, for ye haue doon me more domage than profyte, ſir ſaid the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Aimon. I ſhal gladly doo your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente. And anon he went &amp; lighted on horſebacke, and after ſaid to the peeres of fraunce. Lordes I pray you al that ye wil haue my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, for they be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> com of your bloude, &amp; let the king ſee well to, for yf he make my children to dye by ſuch great vengeaunce as he hath ſayd: if I ſhoulde become a ſaraſyn &amp; dwel in Affryque al the dayes of my lyfe: I ſhal ſtryke of his head, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne other gage I wyll not take. And whan Aimon had ſaid thus: he went out of thoſt into fraunce to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye wel heuy bicauſe that he left his children in ſo great pouerty, &amp; Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne that ſawe Aymon goe thus quite, and that he hadde garnyſhed Mountawban of vitaylles: he was full angrye for it. So ſtudyed he vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this a longe whyle. And whan he had ſtudyed longe ynoughe: he was ſo ſory that none myght be more ſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and returned hym ſelfe towarde hys Barons, and ſayde Lordes I commaund you that ye breake al our engynes. For by theym I haue myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to haue the caſtell of Mountaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban. And incontinente the Barons made breake the engines as the king
<pb facs="tcp:7017:133"/> had commaunded. And by all thus Reinawd abode a long while in good peace, but their vittailles began ſore to mynyſhe. And whan Reinawde ſawe that: he was ſory, and began to complayne in himſelfe, &amp; ſaide good lorde what ſhal I doo? I knowe that at longe rennynge we ſhall not mow holde, and ſo ſhall Charlemain haue no mercye of vs, but he ſhall make vs die. Alas Mawgis where be you? For if ye were with vs we ſhoulde doubte nothinge nor I ſhoulde not ſuffre this great diſtres that I haue. All thus as Reinawde complained hymſelfe: than came Alard that was ſo feble that with payne he mighte ſtande vpon his feete, and ſayde to Reynawd. Reinawde for the loue of god make bayarde to be ſlayne. For I may no lenger lyue without meate, nother yet my bretherne.</p>
            <p>THan whan Reynawd heard his brother Alard ſpeke thꝰ: he was ryght ſorye for it and tooke his ſwerd &amp; went to bayarde for to ſlea him. And whan bayarde ſawe Reynawde he began to make greate Ioye, and whan Reynawde ſaw the there that bayard him made: he ſayd to him. Ha bayarde good beaſte, yf I had the herte to doo thee harme I were well cruell. And than yonnet the yonger ſonne heard that: he cried vnto his father, ſir wherfore tary ye that ye ſlea not bayarde ſith he muſt dye, for I wexe madde for hungre, and ſo I tell you yf I haue not ſhort<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſome foode: ye ye ſhal ſeeme die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyen, &amp; yet my mother &amp; my brother alſo, for we may not lenger lyue thus ſo harde we been famiſhed. And whan Reinawd hearde hys ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſpeake to him ſo: he had great pity of him, and great ſorow in his heart, and ſo he had of bayarde that cheted him ſo muche. Than wiſte not Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde what he ſhould ſaye nor doo, and ſo began to thinke alonge while And whan he had bethoughte him ſelfe longe ynoughe: he aduyſed him howe Bayarde ſhoulde not dye.

            <p>AFter that Charlemayne had ſayd theſe wordes: he began to walke within the Caſtell ſekynge all aboute to ſee yf he might finde Reynawde or any of his bretherne.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery of vs ſhewe hym ſelfe a good knight, for in you is all my truſte, and ſo I promyſe you that I haue leuer di worthely in batayle, than for to be hanged ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as theefe My brethern I praye you come all nighe me.

And I ſweare you vpon my fayth that the foure Sonnes of Aymon ſhall neuer haue peace with me, and ſo I tel you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I feare me not for Rycharde of Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy, for Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſhould rather put out bothe his owne eyen tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he durſt doo to Rycharde any harme vpon his bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy. And whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barons heard Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne ſpeake ſo: the teares began to fal downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr eyen for great feare that Richarde of Normandye theyr Peere ſhould haue any harme. After all theſe thynges Reynawde and his bretherne were wythin Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne making great Ioy. And after they were all out of theyr harneys: Reynawde ordeyned good watche vpon the walles of the Citie. And than he made come the duke Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of Normandy afore hym, &amp; ſayde to him in thys maner. Duke richard ye know wel that the king doth great wronge for to trouble vs ſo as he hath doone, and yet dooth withoute any reſonable cauſe. And therfore I tell you for certayne, but yf that ye make vs to haue peace: thinke not to lyue onye lenger, for I ſhall doo ſmyte of your head and your body to be hewed in foure quarters. Sir ſaid the duke Richarde of Normandye, I am in your daunger, ſo maye ye doo of me your pleaſure. Ye haue taken me by warre, and none otherwyſe: yf ye doo to me otherwyſe than ye ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of ryght of warre, ye ſhall haue dyſſhonour for euer more. And ſo I wyll wel that ye know that as long as I liue: I ſhall not fayle Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne for no feare of death. Whan Reynawde hearde Richarde of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandye ſpeake thus: he refrayned a lytle his wrathe, and than he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould be put in yrons within his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould be well kept and curteyſly, and that he be well ſerued of that appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to hys eſtate. Than was the Duke Rycharde all thus in priſon: but he was well ſerued of all good meates, and he had good companye for to playe to what game that he wolde. And alſo the good Ducheſſe clare dyd vyſite him often, and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted hym with her fayre langage.</p>
            <p>WHan Charlemaine had beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Citie rounde aboute and ſawe that by no ſawtynge, he myght not get it: he dyd doo make

            <p>And whyle that Charlemayne had layde his ſiege thus afore Ardeyne: the king Yon of gaſcoygne fell ſike a bed of a great ſickenes, &amp; ſhrofe hym of al his ſinnes praying god to haue pitie and mercy on hym, and after he had be longe ſycke he died.

And about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre of noone he founde hymſelfe in a great wood where he founde two men makyng euyll cheere and great ſorow, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mawgys ſawe them: he cam to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſayd?

By my othe ſayd another it might well be Mawgis that is ſo dyſguyſed, for to dyſceyue vs. It is not ſo ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. Mawgis is not aliue.

Than tooke Mawgys the browne bread and made ſoppes in water, &amp; eate of it with a good appetite. And whan y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Reynawde ſawe thys poore man afore him that liued ſo poorely and was ſo lene and ſo pale: he had of him great pitie. So tooke he a diſhe that was before him that was full of venyſon, and ſent it to hym bi a ſquier of his that preſented it to hym ſayinge thus, holde good man the duke ſendeth you this, god yelde him ſayd Mawgys, and than he too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke and ſet the dyſſhe afore hym, but he eat nothing of it. And whan Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſawe that: he was greatlye meruailed, &amp; ſaid to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf. god who is that good man that liueth ſo hard a life, if he were not ſo leue: I ſhould ſay that it were my good coſin maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gys, but a nother thing ſheweth me that it is not he. For he wolde not hyde hymſelfe from me in no wyſe.</p>
            <p>REynawde behelde ſtil Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys ſo muche that he left his mete for to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tables were taken vp, &amp; that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man had eaten at his eaſe: they went to their warde for to defende the towne as they were wonte for to doo, in theyr harneys. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde ſawe that euerye man was gone, and that there was no body w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the halle for whome he wolde leue for to ſay hys will: he went to maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys and ſayd to hym, good heremite I pray you for the reuerence of that God that ye ſerue that ye tell me yf ye be Mawgys or no, for ye are well lyke him. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mawgys heard Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd ſpeake thus to hym: he could hide himſelfe no lenger, and ſayd al on hye. Coſyn I am Mawgys wythout doubt.

Than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Mawgis to hym and ſayde, My coſyn be not diſpleaſed of that I ſhal tel you, ye muſt wyt that I haue made my vow to god that I ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eate but alonly breade and wilde herbes and that to my drynke I ſhal take none other but water, and that I ſhal neuer weare the dayes of my lyfe none other clothes but ſuche as this is, for I haue giuen my ſelf vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to ſerue and loue our bleſſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour &amp; hys glorious mother, for to brynge my ſoule to ſaluacyon in the blyſſe that euer ſhall laſte.</p>
            <p>WHan Reynawde hearde his Coſyn Mawgis ſpeke thus: he was in a thought whether it was Mawgys or no, for he coulde not knowe hym well bycauſe he was ſo ſore apayred of his perſon.

And after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had verye knowledge of hym: he made greate ioye for hym. And he prayde hym agayne ſayinge in this wyſe. Fayre Coſin I pray you for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of the fayth that ye owe to me that ye wyl tell me the trouth of that I ſhal aſke you. Syr ſayd Mawgis I ſhall tell it you gladly. Coſyn ſaid Reynawde I wolde wyt where yee haue be euer ſyth that ye went from me, &amp; fro whens ye come nowe Syr ſayd Mawgis ſythe it pleaſe you to wyt of my lyuynge: I ſhall ſhew it you with a good wyll, yee ought to knowe my fayre coſyn for certayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue made my ſelfe an hermite, &amp; I haue left the worlde for to ſerue hym that made me, &amp; the bleſſed vyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn Marye his mother, for to haue pardon of my ſynnes that I haue doone in my lyfe, for I haue doone many great euilles agaynſt my crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tour, &amp; by me are dead ſo many folke wherof I knowe that our Lorde is greatly wrothe agaynſt me. After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Reynawde had hearde Mawgys ſpeake thus: he had ſo great pity on him that the teres fell alonge hys chekes fro his eyen for loue of hys good coſyn. And than he called hys brethern &amp; ſayd to them, come hyther my bretherne &amp; ye ſhal ſe your coſyn Mawgys.

Thus was Reynawde well glad of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cominge of his good coſyn &amp; after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had made greate Ioye a longe whyle: Reynawde called his brother Richarde and ſayd to hym, Brother go fet anon a good gown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AFter all theſe thynges thus ſayd Mawgys prayed Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde that he wolde make haſte to make hym be deliuered, ſuche thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as he had deſyred of hym.

            <p>IN this party ſheweth that the kyng Charlemayne was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſyege of Ardeyn ſore an angred that he myght not know howe Rychard of Normandy dyd. So ſent he for all hys Barons for, to come to hym: And whan they were come in his pauillion, he ſayd to them thus Lordes I ſee wel that it goeth now yll with me, bycauſe I ſee that Rey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde
<pb facs="tcp:7017:143"/> hath not ſent me agayne Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde of Normandy, and he might well haue delyuerd hym free &amp; quite and haue ſende hym vnto me for all the harmes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath doone to me. Vncle ſayde Rowlande I merueyll greatly of that ye ſaye, ye ſhew wel to vs that ye be wythout counſell. By the fayth that I owe to you, ye ſhal neuer ſee Richarde of Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, but yf ye pardon Reynawde &amp; his brethern, diuerſe times he hath meked himſelfe vnto you, and hath be alwayes redy to fulfyll your ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp; ye wyll not take hym to your grace, be not than merueyled if Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſhewe nowe ſome diſpite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt you. For and ye conſider wel the great curteſie that he hath doone vnto you: namely whan he had you at his will within mountawban &amp; that he delyuered you, and ſuffred you goe quite and free fro him at your liberti, ye ſhould doo for him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe than ye doo, but ſyth that Reynawde ſeeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may not finde no mercy in you: he wyll not leeſe his curteſye, but he ſhall doo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte that he can, as ye maye well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue experience of it euery day, for he do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mageth vs dayly, and keepeth his priſoner the beſt knyght that yee had, that is Richarde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, the whych I weene be dead by thys time. Neuew ſayd the kinge Charlemayne, I promyſe you that Reynawde hath not put hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death but he kepeth hym wel at his eaſe &amp; with great honoure, ſyr ſaid than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naymes. Syth that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ben come to this: I muſt tel you my mynde. Syr yf Reynawde bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you dommage: ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not blame hym for it. For he hath prayed you ſo many times humbly that ye wold haue mercy on him and ye wolde ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer heare hym, but ye haue alwayes ſhewed your ſelfe the moſte proude kynge of the worlde agaynſt hym, &amp; the moſte angry, and ye wyll beleue no counſell, and ſo I tell you if Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd hath not made to dye Richard of Normandy: he is the kyndeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worlde. But I beleue better that he is dead than otherwyſe: for no man heere can tell whether he be dead or a liue.</p>
            <p>WHan the kyng Charlemayne heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke Naymes ſpeke thus: he knew wel that he tolde hym trouth. So began he to ſyghe ſore, and to theſe wordes came forthe the Byſſhop Turpin, &amp; Ogyer the dane that ſayd in this maner. Sir wyt it verely that Naymes telleth you trouth. For Reynawde hath a good cauſe to be angrye wyth you. And whan Charlemayne heard his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſpeke thus: he was all abaſſhed of it. And called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke Naimes, the biſſhop Turpyn, Ogier the Dane, &amp; Eſcouf the ſonne of Oedon, &amp; ſayde to them.

And then he ſhall haue peace wyth me al the dayes of my lyfe. Deere ſyr

For I wot wel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis is gone from Reynawde, it is three yeres paſſed and more. And yf that Reynawde wolde delyuer him he may not. For he knoweth not him ſelfe where he is. Naymes ſayd the king Charlemayne, yee ſhall at leſte heare what Reynawde ſhal ſay vnto you, and ye ſhall alſo know how Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde of Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di dooth. Syr ſayd the duke Naymes, ſyth that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you that I ſhall goe: I am well contente, but I pray our Lorde that we maye returne agayne whole and ſounde of our perſones, without to be dyſhonoured. whan the barons ſaw that kinge Charlemayne wolde that they ſhould goe to Ardeyne for to doo his meſſager they durſte not ſaye there agaynſt. And ſo they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thether anon, and eche of them bare in his hande a braunche of an oliue tree in tooken of peace. And whan they came vnto the gate: they founde it open for them. For Reynawde had ſeen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come from ferre. Wherfore he commaunded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wicket ſhould be open. And whan the barons ſaw the litle gate open: they went into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne, and cam to the Palays. And whan Reynawde wyſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were come within the palays: he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and layde hymſelfe downe vpon a bedde wyth hys legges croſſed and ſware God and his bleſſed mother that he ſhould not praye the kinge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne of nothing. For he had doon him to great harme, for throughe the kynge Charlemayn: he had loſte his good coſyn Mawgis and Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>This hanginge: came there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the king Charlemaine, afore Reynawde. Whan the Duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that was the formeſt ſaw Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde: he ſaluted him honourably. And after he ſayd to hym. Syr Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde the kinge ſendeth you worde by vs, that ye ſende hym agayne Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde the duke of Normandy. And more ouer he ſendeth you worde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yf ye wyll delyuer him Mawgys: ye ſhal haue peace with him al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dayes of his lyfe. And he ſhall deliuer you agayne all your landes. And he ſhal keep bothe your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his court with him, and he ſhall make them knightes with his owne handes.</p>
            <p>My Lordes ſayde Reynawde, ye be ryght welcome to me as the knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde that I ought to loue beſt.

For if I had wyll that he wolde haue ben ſo fell vpon me and my brethern: I ſhould well auenged it vpon him. But it is to late to repente me that I did not ſo, wherfore that ye voyde out of my Palays, and goe tell your king that
<pb facs="tcp:7017:144"/> I haue not Mawgys, but I haue loſte hym for him, and alſo yf I had him he ſhould not haue him. And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue thus loſte my good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyn Mawgys for hym: I ſhal make to morow Richarde the duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandy to be hanged vpon the chefe gate of this Citie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpite of him for no lenger reſpite he ſhal not haue of me, how be it that he is of my lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and I tell you, come no more heere, nor no man of Charlemayne. For I promyſe you I ſhall ſtryke of the heades of as many as ſhal come fro him to me without any fayle.</p>
            <p>WHan Ogyer the Dane ſaw Reynawde ſo angry, &amp; that he anſwered ſo proudlye: he meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſore, aad drewe him ſelfe by Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, and ſaid to him.

And whan the barons ſaw that Reynawde was ſo feruently wrothe, they durſt no len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tary there: but tooke leue of him and went out of the Citie, and went lightly to the hoſte of Charlemayne that awayted after them. Whan the kyng ſaw the Barons come: he ſaid vnto them. Lordes ye be welcome. what tidynges brynge you? haue ye not ſeene Rycharde of Normandye? Syr ſayde the Duke Naymes.

Lordes goe make you redy, and we ſhall go vnto Charlemayn. Sir ſayd the three brethern, let vs whan it pleaſe you. And then they went &amp; tooke on the beſt clothing that they had. And I promiſe you they were three fayre knightes, and after they were wel apparayled, they mounted eche of them vpon a palfraye of hye pryce ryght fayre wythout anye ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.

            <p>NOw ye ought to wit that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three brethern of Reynawde came to the pauilion of Charlemain well honeſtly arayed. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were afore the kyng: they kneeled hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And yf it pleaſe you ye ſhal haue the good ducheſſe and her chyldren for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, for ſhe is the humbleſt lady of the worlde, and the moſte wyſeſt. Rycharde ſayd Charlemayne, wyt it that I ſhal not fayle them as long as lyfe ſhalbe in my body. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the children of Reynawde ſhal be in age for to be made knightes: I ſhal doube them to it mine owne handes with great worſhip, and god ſpare me lyfe, and ſo ſhall I gyue them la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>WHan they had deuyſed all y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe of the thynges afore ſayd: the kynge Charlemayne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that he ſhould be dyſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and anon his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was doone, and than euery man put hymſelfe towarde the way towarde his countrie.

            <p>And whan the mornyng was come, he made be brought afore hym the good horſe of Reynawde Bayarde. And whan he ſaw him: he began for to laye in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>NOw ye ought to know that after that bayarde was caſte in the riuer of meuze: he wente vnto the botom as ye haue herde, &amp; might not come vp for bicauſe of the great

            <p>WHan Mawgis vnderſtoode the wordes of Reinawde: he was ryght glad of it.

And whan the erle of Rames ſawe that Reynawde hadde taken but one horſe, one harneys and one ſwerde: he ſayde vnto him.

            <p>WHan the kynge Thomas that was there priſoner ſaw the great feaſt &amp; ioye that the chriſten made: Wiſt not what he ſhould thinke, but ſait to himſelf. Ha goddes what haue now my folk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And than came the admyrall barbas that ſmot in to thoſte of the chriſten. The fyrſte barrailie of the ſaraſins was conduited by a king that had to name Margarys that was lord of the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of Tailes, whiche was ryght cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and dare in his armes a dragon pyctured with an horryble fygure.</p>
            <p>WHan the kyng Margaris ſawe it was time to ſmite vpon the chriſten: he ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his horſe with his ſpurres &amp; ran ayenſt Reinawd.

And whan Reinawd had ſaide this: he ſpurred his horſe and ranne ayenſt Margarys ſo harde that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſheelde nor quyras could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him, but he ſhoued his ſpere tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the breſt and ouerthrew ſterke dead to the grounde. And whan Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde had gyuen that great ſtroke: he ſaide. Goe thy waye to helle the deuill ſpede thee and beare felawſhip to thy predeceſſours that went there afore thee.

Whan therle of Rames had ſayde this to Reynawde: he ſpurred his horſe with the ſpurres and ſmote a turke ſuch a ſtroke that he made the yren of his ſpere to apeece at the back of him that he fel dead to therth, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he tooke his ſwerde in his hand &amp; began to crye Rames as hie as he coulde, ſayinge barons ſmite nowe a good, for the perſians ſhall be nowe vtterly dyſcomfyted, yf god keep the valliaunt Reynawd of Mountawba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his valiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t coſin Mawgis.

            <p>WHan thadmirall Barbas ſawe that his folke were dyſcomfited: he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry for it &amp; ſaid whoreſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, whi doo ye ſlee thus awai know you not thus I am your lorde, that ſhal defend you ayenſt this vnhappy chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?

Erle of Lames ſayd the kynge, I pray you that ye wyll tell hym in my behalfe this that I haue ſayd to Geffray of nazareth, ſyr ſaid therle wyth a good wyll I ſhall doo ſo. And than he went to Reynawde &amp; ſhewed to him al that the king had ſayd.

So tooke hym by the neck &amp; had him to the wyndowe &amp; ſayd al hye Reynawde of Mountawban I ſhall angre you, for I ſhall caſte the king Thomas downe if ye pardon me not, &amp; I ſhall ſlea my ſelf whim, for I may wel die after ſuch a king. And whan the duke Riynawde ſaw that the kyng Thomas hynge thus the head downewarde all redy for to fall: he had great pitie of hym &amp; ſaid Ha good lorde what ſhal I doo? for if I leue the ſawte: it ſhalbe greate ſhame, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towre is almoſte taken, and of the other part it ſhalbe great myſſhape yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good kinge Thomas take death for it.

Thadmirall was ryght glad wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard Reynawde ſpeake thus, ſo drew he vp the kyng Thomas agayne and ſayde to hym, kyng Thomas ye ſhall go quite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, and than he wente downe with the kyng &amp; opened the gate, &amp; went our he &amp; his two men. There was made great ioye betwene the kynge Thomas and Reynawde.

            <p>Now tell me and it pleaſe you if ye haue made peace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Charlemayn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great kynge of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath doon you ſo great hinderaunce.

After that the kynge had ſayd thys worde: they came downe fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towre of dauyd for to go to the holy ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre.

And whan all this was doone the barons of ſurre tooke leue of the kyng of Reynawde &amp; of maw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gis, &amp; after went euery man into hys place in theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, &amp; the ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g toke Reynawde &amp; Mawgis and brought them to hys palays where he feaſted them a hundred dayes honourablye.

            <p>THan whan the two brethern the ſonnes of Reinawde of Mountawban were come in to the hall: they ſaw the kinge amonge his barons ſo went they vnto hym, and kneeled downe afore him, and kiſſed his feete. And than Aymonet ſpake firſt and ſaid. Sir god giue you good life &amp; longe, and keepe from euill all youre noble companye. Sir we are come to you for to haue the ordre of knighthod, if it pleſe your good grace to giue it to vs, for of no better hand than is youres: We can not haue it, wherfore ſir we beſeche you humbly for god and for the loue of our father that it will pleaſe you to receyue vs in your ſeruiſe vnto the time ye giue the ſaide ordre of knightehode, who be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king that ſpeake thus?

And than whan the barons heard the two children ſpeake ſo wiſely: they were glad of it and alſo of their comming. But the two ſonnes of Foulques of Moryllon were full ſory and wrothe for it, by my ſoule ſayde Conſtans to his brother Rahars the father of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe two chyldrene ſlewe oure father, wherof the hert in my body ſwelleth highe for angre that I ſee them heere nother min eyen can not looke vpon them, brother ſaid Rohars, nor I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by my trouthe, but I counſeyll not that we fight with them not hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, for it were foly. But let vs await a tyme and place couenable, for ſyth that they ſhall dwell heere: We ſhall auenge vs vpon them. Brother ſaid Conſtans, lette vs doo one thynge, that I ſhall tell you, whiche is eaſye for to doo, that ye ſhall calle the one of treaſon: and I the other, ſayinge that theyr father ſlewe our father by treaſon. And alſo we ſhall proue that their father wroughte treaſon ayenſt the king Charlemayn, brother ſayde Rohars, ye ſpeake well, but we muſt ſuffre a while till we ſee howe they ſhal bere themſelf in court, for &amp; they doo any otherwyſe than they oughte to doo: We ſhal mowe kylle them and be not blamed for it. After this doon: ye oughte to knowe that the children of Reinawde of Mountawban, bare themſelfe full honeſtlye in courte, for all the barons loued them dere, ſaue only the two ſonnes of Foulques of moryllon, wherof Aimonet and yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net perceyued it ryght well, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke not with them, nor haunted theim not.

And of the other parte they kepte a great eſtate and good houſe to al poore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylmen and ſquiets, and dyd ſo much good that they were greately praiſed of euerye manne. What ſhoulde I telle you more? the childrene of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde dyd ſo muche in the courte of the king Charlemayne: that of all the worlde they were loued, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypallye of the kinge Charlemayne. whan the kinge ſawe that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued theim ſo well and ſo wiſely in his court: he was ryght glad of it ſo loued he theym moſte of anye yonge knyght of his courte, and made them his keruers a fore hym. And thenne whan the two ſonnes of Foulques of Moryllon ſawe that the kynge loued theim ſo muche: they were full angrye, in ſo muche that they wexed mad all quicke for angre of it, and ſo ſwate by greate angre that they ſhould ſlea the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or euer theiſhould goe to

It happed ſo that vpon whyt ſonday euyn as the kyng was at Parys, and wolde keep ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> courte, and there was Aymonet and yonnet with the other barons in the halle. This hanging: aryued there a knyghte of Almayne that preſented to the kynge a fayre knyfe after the facyon of the londe, then called the king yonnet &amp; gaue it him by greate loue. And whan yonner had receiued this gyft of the kyng &amp; as he ſhoulde haue gone to his place agayn: he ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Conſtans with his elbowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſt his wil. And whan Conſtans ſaw that yonnet had doon ſo: he had greate diſpite at it, and ſaide. What is this? muſt there be ſo muche ſet by theſe two boies the ſonnes of a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, whiche been not worth a roten apple? &amp; this one is all redye become ſo proude that he hathe nowe ſhoued me with his elbowe by great enuye and pride, muche other langage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans ſaide by Yonnet: Whiche he ought not for to ſaye, and whan yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net hearde that Conſtans had called him the ſonne of traytour: he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re an angred. So came he to him and ſaide Conſtans ye haue learned a foule craft, that is that ye can ſpeake ſhrewdely withoute a cauſe lawfull why, for I haue hearde that ye haue called me and my brother the ſonnes of a traitour, &amp; that the kinge know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well that our father ſlewe yours by treaſon, wherof I will ye wyt that ye lie falſely, but your father did aſſail oures by treaſon as a traitour, come of the lignage of traitoures. But God wolde not that my father ſhoulde dye ſo, nor myne vncles. my father ſlew your father, it is true, but it was in his defendynge of hys body, &amp; he did then as a noble knight, as he is, and if ye be ſo hardy that ye wil maintein that he did it by treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: heere I caſt now my gage afore thys noble companye, ſaying that ye haue lied falſely, ſaue the reuerence of the kinge Charlemayne, and of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawſhyp.</p>
            <p>THan whan the kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſawe that none of the barons ſaid nothyng of the ſtryfe of yonnet and of Conſtans: he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry for it, and ſayde.

Lordes ſaide Charlemain I take them you to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, and I charge you to bryng them againe to the court whan time ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be. Syr ſayd the ſureties we ſhal doo as ye commaund vs. And whan the king had receiued the ſureties of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans and of Rohars: Aymonet and yonnet came forth, &amp; ſaid in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sir heere been our gages howe that we wil defende that oure father ſlew neuer Foulques of morillon by treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Children ſaid the king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine ye ſpeake well, but I muſt haue ſurety of you as I haue of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, yf I wil doo reaſon, than lept forth Rowland Olyuer, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Naimes of bauyre, Ogier of den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, Richarde of Normandy, and Eſcoufe the ſonne of Oedon, which ſaid to the kyng. Syr we been ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the ſonnes of Reinawd, &amp; we ſhall preſent theim to you at the daye of bataill. Sirs ſaide the king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne it pleaſeth me wel, but the chyldren of Reynawde been not yet knightes as ye know, but by the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the that I owe to god they ſhall be to morowe, and than we ſhal ſende our letters to Reynawde that he come to ſee the battayl of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for thys daie fourty dayes I deuyſe it. Whan the euyn came: the kyng Charlemain made be called hys ſtuarde and ſayde to hym. Goe and bryng me to morow the ſonnes of Reynawde, for I wyll that they ben to morow named knigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, and ſee that they been well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, for I wyll doo this for the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of theyr father, and puruey ſo that they haue eche of theim a good cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and good harnays mete for their bodyes. Whan the ſtuarde hearde the commaundement of the king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne: he dyd well the tenour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And whan the morning came: the ſtuarde brought Aimonet, &amp; yonnet, well apoynted, and in theyr compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye all ſuche other as the kynge for their loue wolde make knightes that daye. And whan that they were afore the kinge: Aymonet and Yonnet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred the ordre of knyghthode, to whome the kinge gaue it with good hearte, and in lyke wiſe the other for loue of them, and than was a greate feaſt made that daye. And whan the feaſt was finiſhed: Charlemain too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a meſſager, whiche he ſente vnto Reinawd of Mountawban, and ſent him worde that he ſhould come to the court with good companye, for hys chylderne were called of treaſon, by
<pb n="clxi" facs="tcp:7017:166"/> the ſonnes of Foulques of Morillon ſayinge that he had ſlayne theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by treaſon, and how hys childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had caſte their gages, ſayinge that they had lyed falſely.</p>
            <p>THan whan the duke Reinaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de hearde theſe tydynges that Charlemayne ſent hym: he meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of it ſore. Than ſent he for all his bretherne by his letters y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhoulde com to him in armes, for it was nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. And whan the bretherne of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde vnderſtoode theſe tydynges: without anye taryinge they came to the brother at Mountawban. And whan Reinawde ſawe them: he was glad and kyſſed them thone after the other, and after he tolde them al that the king Charlemayne had giue him to knowe, and whan the brethern of Reynawde vnderſtoode it: they mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylled of it, brother ſaide Rycharde doubte not, for the mater ſhall come better than ye weene of, by the grace of god. I counſeyll that we goe to the court of the kyng Charlemayne. For whan we ſhall be there we ſhal ſoone vnderſtonde the kinges mynde, and what his will is towarde you, and I promiſe you, yf he hathe doone anye wronge to our neuewes your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god neuer haue mercye on my ſoule, but I ſhal ſlee him, what hap therof Brother ſaide Reinawde I wyl wel that we goe to Paris, and whan we ſhal be there, we ſhal wel vnderſtond how the kinge Charlemaine bereth himſelfe toward my chyldren. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayd Alard, ye ſpeake well &amp; wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelye, &amp; me ſemeth after myne aduiſe that we ought to goe thither without anye longe taryinge. And whan they were there to accorded: they departed fro Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tawban with a right noble company, and ſo muche they rode by their Iourneys that they came to the citie of parys. And whan they were come there: al the .xii. peeres knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of their coming, and went ayenſt them, and brought with them Aymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net &amp; yonnet, and receyued Reinawd &amp; his bretherne with great ioye &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And whan Reynawd ſaw his two fayre ſonnes: he ſaid to them in this wiſe. My children now ſhal it be ſeen if ye be my ſonnes or no. For and ye be my chylderne, ye ſhall auenge me of that great ſhame that theſe trai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>toures put vpon me without a cauſe. Father ſaid the chyldren: doubte not therof, for &amp; they were .x. ayenſt vs, yet ſhall we ouercome theym by the grace of god. For euerye man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well that ye be as true a knyghte as any is in the worlde. And whan the kynge Charlemaine knewe the comyng of Reinawd that was come ſo well accompanyed: he was gladde of it, and ſent worde to Reynawde that he ſhould come to him, the which thynge Reynawde dyd, and whan the kyng ſaw him he made him good chere and with good hearte, and alſo to his brethern. And whan Reinaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de had be with the king a longe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le: he tooke leue of him &amp; went to his lodges again, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was there he callede his bretherne and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp; ſaid to them. My ſonnes come hither, tell me how the kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn bereth himſelfe towarde you, &amp; what he ſayth of this quarell that ye haue vndertake. I muſte knowe
<pb facs="tcp:7017:167"/> the trouth of it. Father ſayd the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, wyt it that the kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne loueth vs muche, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treteyneth vs aboue all other honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, for the loue of you that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ryghte much, as he ſayth. And than they tolde him how he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de them knightes, and how he ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their quarell ayenſt the traytou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and all other.</p>
            <p>WHan Reinawde and his brethern heard the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeake thus: they were glad of it, for they doubted leſt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine wolde haue faten euell with them. And whan Reynawd of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban wiſt that the king had borne hymſelfe ſo wel toward his ſonnes: he ſaide that he ſhoulde ſerue hym e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore as his ſouerayne lorde. And on the morowe Reinawde went for to ſee the king at his riſyng from his bed and thanked him muche of the greate worſhyp that he had doone to his chyldren. Than ſaid Charlemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to him. Reinawde euer ſyth that I ſawe that ye dyd my commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente with good wil, &amp; that ye were obeynge to me: I dyd caſte all myne angre from me, and all the euyll wyll that I had ayenſt you, and I wil that ye wit that I am wel yours, and ſhal be as longe as I lyue in this worlde, for I take you for one of my beſt freendes. And whan Reinawd heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> debonairtie and the kinde wordes of the king: he caſt himſelf to the feet of him, and in lykewiſe dyd all hys bretherne, and thanked him muche, &amp; wyt that Reinawd &amp; his bretherne abode in parys with greate Ioye and pleaſure vnto the daye of the batayll that ſhoulde be of his childerne. And this hangyng: Reynawde had doon make good harnays for his chyldren and had pourueyed two good horſes for them.</p>
            <p>THan whan the day of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayll was come: the chyldren of Foulques of Moryllon came and preſented them afore the kynge redy for to fyght. And whan the kyng ſaw them: he ſaide to theim.

And whan the earle Guanellon &amp; al they of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lygnage of Foulques of morillon heard the king ſpeake ſo: they were ſo greatlye abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei wiſt not what thei ſhould doo, but kept al their peace, &amp; aſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no word. And than ſaid Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the king. Syr we pray you for god that ye wyll telle to vs the place where we ſhall fight ayenſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Than ſtood vp the duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of bauyere, &amp; ſaid, ſyr Conſtans ſpeaketh well, ye muſt deuiſe the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and where they ſhall fyght two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenſt .ii. or one ayenſt a nother alone. Naymes ſayde the kyng, I wyl that ye Iudge this matter, ſir ſith that it pleaſe you ſo: I ſhal beſpeake it with a good will. Syr ſaid the duke Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, me ſemeth, bycauſe that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans hath called the ſonnes of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawd to batayl both for one mater: that they ought to fight two ayenſt
<pb n="clxii" facs="tcp:7017:167"/> nawde to battayl both for one matter that they ought to fyght two ayenſt two, and al foure togyther. Syr ſayd Reynawde, the duke Naymes ſayth ryght well. By my fayth Reinawde ſayde the kinge Charlemayne, and I graunt it ſo, but I wyll that the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taylle be made in the yſle of our ladye within ſauoine to morow in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge. And whan the kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne had ſayde thus: the barons tooke leue of him, &amp; eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went to their lodges, and Reinawde alſo the which tooke his two ſonnes with him, and the two ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of Foulques of Moryllon went alſo with theyr freendes. Whan Reinawde and his bretherne had ſouped, and had made good there: he made brynge harneis ynoughe, and made Alarde and Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde, and hys two chyldren aymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and yonnet, to be armed. And tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made to be ſhewed to Aymonet and to yonnet howe they ſhoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende themſelf of their enemies, and in what maner they ſhoulde aſſaylle them. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that this was doon: Reynawde dyd ſende hys chyldren to ſainte Vyctoure and the traytoures went to ſaynt Germayne for to wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che that nyghte. And whan the daye came: a byſhop that was of the lyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of Conſtans and of rohars ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge maſſe afore his coſins, &amp; the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe Turpyn ſaid maſſe affore the ſonnes of Reinawd, which was with them at ſaint Victoure, and alſo the tuelue peeres of Fraunce. And whan the yonge knightes had hearde the maſſe: they came al in their harnays to the palays before the kynge Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemayne. And whan the kynge ſawe them: he called his neuew Rowland and Olyuer, the duke Naimes of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyete, and Richarde of Normandye, and ſayde to them. Lordes ye ben all my menne. I commaunde you vpon the trouthe that ye owe to me, that ye goe keep the feeld by ſuch maner that my honoure be ſaued by it, and that ye keep to euery man his ryghte. For by the fayth that I owe to god, yf the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re be any man ſo hardy that wyll doo any outrage: I ſhall angre hym right ſore. Wherfore I wyll that ye paſſe the water of Sayne, in to the ylle wyth the fyghters and that ye beare wyth you the halowes, for to make theym ſwete there vpon, a fore they ſhall entre in to the feelde, that they goe to it all in good quarell truly. Sir ſaide the barons, we ſhall doo youre commaundemente, and alſo we ſhall keep therin well your honour, for we ben bounde therto. Lordes ſayde the kynge Charlemayne, ye ſpeake wel, but ye muſt take good heede well to all. For there ſhall be great folke ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the one parte, &amp; of the other, wherfore I feare me that ſome med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge ſhall happe amonge them. For Rohars is full of greate treaſon, and all his freendes I know it well. And of the other parte. Reynawde &amp; hys bretherne are ryghte puyſſaunte and wiſe, and thei haue great power with them, and they wyl not ſee themſelfe wronged, and namely Rycharde the brother of Reinawd, for &amp; if he be ons angrye: he ſpareth nother kynge nor erle. And therfore I feare him moſt of all the other, for he wolde once haue ſlayne me, I am yet remembred ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Of Reynawde I doubte not for
<pb facs="tcp:7017:168"/> he is in euery thyng reaſonable. Sir ſaide the duke Naymes be not dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed of nothyng, for we ſhall keep well youre ryght and your honoure without to doo any wronge to any body. This hanging: the children of Foulques of Moryllon went to the ſaid yſle, where as the king Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main had told them that they ſhould fight. And whan they were paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the riuer in to the yſle with their horſes: they bounde theim and than they ſet theim ſelfe downe vpon the faire graſſe, waytinge after theyr aduerſe partie. Now heare what the traitoures had ordeyned, ye ought to wyt that whyle the kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine had ſpoken with his Barons as ye haue heard: Berenger, Ardock and Griffon of haute braunche dyd put themſelfe in a buſhe, nygh by the ſaide yſle of oure lady, and purpoſed that yf the ſonnes of Reynawde had the better of the feelde ayenſt the two other ſonnes of Morillon: that than they ſhoulde yſſue oute vpon theym, with a right great numbre of folke, for to ſlea them ſhamefully.</p>
            <p>WHan that Reinawd ſaw that it was time that hys ſonnes ſhoulde goe to the yſle for to accomplyſh their battaille: he called Aymonet, &amp; ſaid to him, com hither faire ſonne ye be the eldeſt, and therfore ye ought to be honoured afo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the yonger brother, holde I gyue you flamberge my good ſwerde, by the whiche ye ſhall take vengeaunce of theſe traytours. For ye been in the righte, and they in the wrong, father ſaid Aymonet, ye may be in a ſuretie that ye ſhal ſee this day ſuche a thing that ſhal be to youre hertes ioye, for we ſhall bring the traitours to their ſhamefull death, &amp; it pleaſe god. And whan Reinawd heard hys ſonne ſo valiauntly ſpeake: he was glad, and kiſſed him. And than he gaue hym his benediccion, and in lykewiſe to yonnet. And whan he had doon this: he broughte his bretherne &amp; his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the yſle of our lady. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were ouer: he and his bretherne came again towarde the kynge. But as they wolde haue gone: there came a meſſengat that aſcried to Reinaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de as loude as he might. Reynawde haue mercy on thy children. For yf thou ſee not wel to them: they be loſt. wyt that Griffon of haute braunche is embuſſhed with a greate numbre of folke by the ille for to ſlea thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And whan Reynawde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode theſe wordes: he bluſtred red in his face all for angre, and ſayde. Ha ſweet fraunce, that it is great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that ye may neuer be withoute traytoures. And whan he ſaid this: he called his brother Richarde, and ſaid to him. Faire brother goe wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tarying, and arme your ſelfe, and doo arme al our folke, and than bring theym to the yſle and if the falſe trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure Griffon of hautbraunche come for to greue my childerne: ſlea hym incontinence. And whan ye be there: doo that ye maye be ſeen of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes. And for God keepe well yf the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of Foulques of morillon haue the better: that ye help not in no wiſe my childerne, but let theym dye if it come ſo. For it were greate dyſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure for vs: yf ye dyd otherwiſe,
<pb n="cxliii" facs="tcp:7017:168"/> Brother ſayd Richarde, let me alone therof, our worſhip ſhal be ſaued by the grace of god. For I wolde not helpe yf it came ſo for al the good of the worlde. For all oure lyfe dayes we ſhould be rebuked of it, &amp; all oure lygnage alſo. And whan Richarde had ſayd ſo: he departed fro his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, and went and armed hym and all his folke, and then they lyghted on horſebacke, &amp; went anon there as Reynawd had ſayd. This hanging: went Reynawde to the kinge in hys palays, and when the kynge ſawe him, he ſayde to him Reynawd ye be ryght welcome. Syr ſayde Reinaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, god encreaſe youre honoure, and whan Charlemayne ſawe not Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde with his bretherne: he tooke ſome ſuſſpecion of him and ſayde to Reynawde. Where is youre brother Rycharde that he is not heere with thother. Sir ſayd Reinawde he is gone there as I haue ſent him but take no ſuſſpeccion at al for him: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I doo ſaid Charlemayn as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>THus as the kynge Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne was gon vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re for to ſee the battayll: he looked &amp; ſawe come the brother of reynawd, and a great company of men armed. And whan Charlemayn ſaw him: he knewe hym well, for he bare hys owne cote of armes, and Rycharde had doon ſo for bycauſe he ſhould be knowen. And whan Charlemayne ſaw this: he was all abaſſhed of it, and thenne he called Reynawde and ſayde to hym. What wyl ye doo Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, wyll ye dyſhonour me? haue ye forgoten all redy youre trouthe? Syr ſayde Reynawd nay, ſaue your reuerence, but I wyll ſerue you and worſhyp you as my ſouerayn lorde. why ſaid the kynge Charlemayne, is Richarde gon in to the yſle of our lady with ſo great felawſhip for to breake the feelde of the which thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.

            <p>ANd whan Rycharde of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawban ſawe Charlemayn: he knew well that he was come for to keepe the feeld, and that the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſhould not con doo any thing to his neuews. So ſaid he to his fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke let vs take of our harneys. For ſyth that the kyng is heere himſelf: we need not to wayte heere no more. Than went Richarde and his folke and dyſarmed them. And whan Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde had doone ſo: he lyght agayn vpon his horſe, and came agayne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ryuer of Saynt ſwyminge vnto the foreſayd yſle. And whan he was on lande: he ſpurred his horſe, and made him to lepe three or foure lepes afore the company. And than he came ſtreyght afore the kyng, and made to him reuerens honourably. whan the kinge ſawe Rycharde: he ſayd to hym, and ye Rycharde wyll ye dyſhonour me, that are come in arme for to breke my feeld? Syr ſaid Rycharde ſaue your grace, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought it, but wyt it well for certayne, that yf Gryffron of haut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che had come for to greue mine neues: I wolde haue made his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head for to ſwete. Syr ye be our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerayne lorde, ſo ought ye to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and keepe vs, and ſo ſhall I tell you a thing afore al your barons, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yf ye beleue the traytours of Mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: ye ſhall ones repent it. I am well a payed that ye &amp; your .xii. peres haue ſeen the treaſon of Griffon of haut-braunche, how he wolde haue ſlayne mine neuews.

Syr ſayd Rycharde it pleaſeth me well, but I tell you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yf I ſhould dye: I ſhould neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre my neuews to be wronged.

Than whan Charlemayne had ſayde ſo: he went to the two children of Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Moryllon, and ſayd to them now lordes hye you of that ye haue to doo, goe and ſwere vpon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iuſtly ye entre in this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. Syr ſayd they we ſhall doo it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ryght good wyll, for the chyldren of Reynawde ben dead, but yf that they confeſſe, that theyr father ſlew our father by treaſon. Then ſpake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſſhop Turpin, and ſayd, Lordes come hither, and ſwere vpon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, &amp; ſee to that ye forſwere not yourſelf, for he that forſwereth him ſelfe ſhalbe ouer throwen, no doubte therof, whan the biſſhop Turpin had ſaid this: the two ſonnes of foul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ques of moryllon kneeled downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the halowes, and ſware that rei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nawde of Mountawban had ſlayne theyr father by treaſon, &amp; after they had made theyr othe: they kyſſed the Halowes, and offred two beſans of golde. And than went and lyghted vpon theyr horſes. And thꝰ as they lyghted: they were to nye eche other
<pb facs="tcp:7017:170"/> ſo that thone hurted thother ſo hard: that they fel downe almoſte both to the erth. And whan Reynawde ſaw this: he ſayd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other barons heere is an euyll token. I beleue that they ben forſworne. This hanging: cam the children of Reinawde, that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led afore the halowes and ſwore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the two ſonnes of Foulques of Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryllon had lied falſely all that they had ſayd. And then they put their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des vpon the halowes, and offred a ryche gifte, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Byſſhop Turpyn gaue them the benediction, &amp; in lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyſe the kynge Charlemayne, and all the other barons, &amp; than of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde, and of his brethern and after they wente and mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vpon their horſes lightly.</p>
            <p>WHan the foure Champions were vpon theyr horſes: thei made none other taryenge: but gaue the ſpurres to theyr horſes, and ran one againſt an other and ſmote eche other in theyr ſheeldes ſo ſore: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſperes flew in peeces without y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any of them fell on the ground. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had broken their ſperes: thei ſet hande vnto their ſwerdes. Than Aymonet that helde Flamberge in hys hande ſayde vnto Yonnet hys brother. I pray you brother thynke to doo well. For if ye helpe me, they ſhalbe vtterly ſhamed and diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as traytours as they ben. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayd Yonnet doubt not, for I ſhall neuer fayle you to the death, &amp; alſo we ought to recomfort vs. For we ben in the ryght, and they be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wronge. Whan the two brethern had ſpoke ynoughe: they went bothe at ones vpon theyr enemyes, wyth theyr ſwerdes in theyr handes. And than Aymonet ouertooke Conſtans with flamberge his ſwerd, and gaue him ſuche a ſtroke that the ſwerde ſlyded vpon the viſer, and kut it and his noſe a ſunder. And whan Aymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ſawe that the noſe of his enemie fall to the erth: he mocked him &amp; ſaid to him. By god Conſtans it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with you than it was afore, for ye ſhall neuer ben without a mocke, for that, that this ſtroke hath doone vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to you, for Flamberge ſlew your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo ſhal it doo you &amp; it pleaſe god. And whan Rohars ſawe that his brother was ſo ſore wounded: he ranne vpon Yonnet and gaue hym ſo mighty a ſtroke vpon hys helme: ſo that yf it had not ben of good fine ſteele: he had ſlaine hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without fayle. This hangyng: Aymonet ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne vpon Conſtans and gaue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuche a ſtroke vpon hys helme, that he made him for to bowe hys backe vpon the ſadle, &amp; for the great might of the ſtroke: the horſe muſte for veri need fall down vpon his knees, and ſmote his muſſell into the erth. And whan that the horſe felt that ſtroke: he roſe lightly vp agayne all afray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and began for to runne thoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medowes maugre of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as mad, nor Conſtans had not the myghte for to rule hym: bycauſe he was a maſed and a ſtonied of that ſtroke, that he had receyued. And than Aymonet and Yonnet wente bothe vpon Rohars, and beganne to fare foule with him, and whan Rohars ſawe hymſelf ſo ſharpelye
<pb n="clxv" facs="tcp:7017:170"/> handled: he began to crye with a hie voyce. Brother where be you, ſhall ye ler me thus to be ſlayne falſly? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtans that ranne throughe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was comen agayne to himſelf and apeaſed his horſe a litle heard his brother crye. So came he agayn to hym: and ſmote Aymonet vpon his helme a great ſtroke, but the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me was good, and dommaged hym not. And whan that Conſtans ſawe that he had not ſlayne Aymonet w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſtroke: he wend to haue gone out of his wit, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other part: he ſaw the place that was al couered with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of his brother, ſo wyſt not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans what to doo. For Aymonet gaue hym ſo muche to doo.</p>
            <p>THys hanging: Yonnet tooke Rohars bi the helme, &amp; wolde haue ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled him by fyne force. But whan Conſtans ſaw that: he ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hys horſe with the ſpurres, and ſhoued him betwene Rohars &amp; Yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, ſo that it was force to yonnet to let goe hys priſe wolde he or no. And whan Aymonet ſaw that Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had deliuered Rohars from the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of yonnet: he went &amp; ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne vpon Conſtans and ſmote him with flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge vpon the ſheelde ſo harde that he made of it two peeces. Shortlye to ſpeake: the chyldren of Reynawde haſted ſo muche the two ſonnes of Foulques that they began to leſe place, &amp; were ſo werye, that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked none other thyng: but for to reſt themſelfe. But Aymonet &amp; yonnet had none other wyll: but for to fight ſtill, &amp; I tell you for certayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were all foure ſore wounded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they loſt much bloud for they had fought longe. And whan Conſtans had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned a litle: he came vpon Aymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net and gaue him ſuche a ſtroke: ſo that he made him a great wounde, but no dead wounde. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet ſaw him ſo wounded: he gaue Conſtans ſo great a ſtroke vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eare: that he bare it away withal the iawe bone, whan charlemayne ſaw that great ſtroke: he might not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, but he ſaid. By god now is he worſe arayed tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was before, for the two ſonnes of Foulques of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillon be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhamed and confuſed. Sir ſayd Reynawde they haue well deſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued it, for they haue forſworne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfe falſly. This hanging: Yonnet went vpon Rohars, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke vpon hys helme: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he brake it, and made his ſwerde to entre in his head a finger deep. Wyt it that the batayle laſted longe the one agaynſt the other, and it happed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by force of fighting, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one againſt the other: they were fyghtyng two &amp; two together, wel a bowe ſhot from eche other, and ſo made they two batayles, for aymonet fought agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt Conſtans, &amp; yonnet faught agaynſt Rohars, which was fore greued, for Yonnet had brought hym to the erth And whan yonnet ſawe that he had brought downe rohars: he ſayd that it were ſhame to fyght with hym on horſbacke agaynſt him on foote, ſo lighted he downe for to fyght wyth Rohars. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had haba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his horſe: In contynent the ſaid horſe ran to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſe of Rohars and wolde haue ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled him. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charlemayne ſaw that: he began to
<pb facs="tcp:7017:171"/> laughe with it and ſayd, by my fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th we haue three batayles. But I ſe well that Yonnet hath brought Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hars ſo lowe that he may no more. whan Rohars ſaw that he myght no more endure the great ſtrokes of Yonnet: he began to crye and ſayde Ha fayre brother Conſtans, where are ye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye come not &amp; helpe me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are ſo good a knight, and that toke firſt the quarell in hande, wherof it goeth full euyll with vs. For yf ye ſuccour me not now: I ſhall dye incontinent And whan Conſtans heard his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther crye thus: he left Aymonet, and went towarde Yonnet, for to helpe hys brother, but wyt it well that he went not very ſounde from Aymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, for he had made hym moe than xx. woundes. And whan Conſtans was come to hys brother: Inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent he ranne vpon Yonnet wyth his horſe. And whan Aymonet ſaw that: he began to crie after Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and ſayd. By my ſoule he baptyſed you full yl y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> named you Conſtans. For I ſaw neuer more towarde tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye be that ſo renneth away for feare of me, &amp; whan he had ſayd ſo: he ran after for to ſuccour hys brother yon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>net. And whan he was come there: he went a freſſhe vpon Conſtans, &amp; Conſtans vpon hym, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which gaue him a great ſtroke vpon his helme but the ſtroke ſlyded vpon the horſe and ſlew hym withall. And whan Aymonet haw him a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: he righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hym quickely &amp; ſmote Conſtans vpon his helme and it was ſo harde that flamberge coulde not entre in it &amp; the ſtroke ſlyded vpon the vyſer &amp; braſt it, and a great part of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſo that the teeth were ſeen plai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nely, and with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtroke vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſe necke, ſo that he kit it in two peeces, and ſo fell the horſe dead to the erth.</p>
            <p>SOre abaſſhed was Conſtans whan he ſaw his horſe ſlain, and than Aymonet ſayd to him. By god falſe traytour nowe ſhalt thou dye, ye dyd yll whan ye called euer my father of treaſon, whiche is as true a knyght as is anye in all the worlde, but now is the daye come y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſhall abye it ful deere. And whan Reynawde heard his ſonne ſpeake thus: he was ryght glad of it, &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God therof hertlye, &amp; whan Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet ſaw Conſtans vpon his feet agayne: he went him vpon, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted hym ryght ſore with ſtrokes ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Conſtans had no power to ſtrike one ſtroke more, but he went abacke heere and there for to eſchew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Aymonet. And whan Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wyſt no more what to doo: he caſt hys ſheelde to the erth, and tooke Aimonet by the waſte for to wraſtle with hym. And whan ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet ſaw this he was not afearie of it, for he was ſtronge and lyght ſo tooke he Conſtans by the helme, and drew it towarde him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch might that he pulled it from the head of him. And whan Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſaw him ſo ſore handled: he cryed vpon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rohars &amp; ſayd. Ha brother ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me, for I haue no power for to defende my ſelfe. Whan Rohars heard his brother call thus: he was ful ſory y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might not help him for he had loſt ſo much bloud y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might
<pb n="Clvi" facs="tcp:7017:171"/> not well ſtand vpon his feete but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes he forced himſelfe ſo muche that he came vnto his brother Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans, and wende to haue ſmitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet from behynde, but he dyd not bycauſe Aymonet ſaw hym come, &amp; went and ſmote hym ſuche a ſtroke that he felled hym to the earth. And than went agayne vpon Conſtans, and gaue him ſuche a ſtroke that he ſmote almoſte his left arme of.</p>
            <p>Than began Conſtans to crye and ſayd. Ha fayre brother ſuccour me: or els I am dead. Brother ſayde Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hars I can gyue you nother ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res nor helpe, for I am my ſelf nere gone, and whan Charlemayn ſaw this: he ſayd, by god now are dead y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonnes of Foulques or morillon by theyr falſe wit. Syr ſayd Ogier ye ought not to recke, for they mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned a falſe quarell, ye ſay trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th ſayd Charlemayn. Nowe theyr falſhoode apereth well. Whan Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde ſaw rhat his children were to their aboue: he was ryght glad of it. but ſo was not Guanellon, for he was ſo angry for it: that he became as blacke as a moore. Then called the ſayd Guanellon Berenger, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rdock, Henry of Lyon and Pigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell of Moryllon and ſayd to them. Lordes now be we all dyſhonoured, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonnes of Foulques of Moril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon are diſcomfited, I wolde fayne ſuccour them yf I durſt but I feare to ſore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge that is there wyth great puyſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

            <p>THis hanging: Aimonet ſaw that he had ſmiten Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a dead wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: ſo was he ryght glad of it, by god brother ye haue doone yll y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye haue ſlayne this falſe tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, for I wolde haue ſlayne hym wyth myne owne handes, but ſyth ye haue brought it ſo ferre: make an ende of hym at ones and I ſhall goe ſlea Rohars. Brother ſayde Aymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ye ſpeake wel, now go ſlea the one and I the other, for thus ought men to doo wyth traytours. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ran the two brethern vpon theyr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that laye on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that is to wyt vpon Conſtans to whom he ſayd al on hye, bycauſe all they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> looked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould heare it.

Syr ſayd Reynawd I ſhal wel holde it in my armes as longe as ye wyl, than the mayſter made the place redi there as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone ſhould be ſet, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was redy: he ſayd to Reynawde, let go the ſtone my freende whan ye will, and bleſſed be god &amp; the houre that euer ye were borne, &amp; whan rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde had ſet downe the ſtone: the mayſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould fet hym morter, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a good wyl ſayde Reynawde. Than came Reynawde downe and laded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morter more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .x. other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue doone, &amp; bare it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſter maſon &amp; ſayd to
<pb n="clxx" facs="tcp:7017:175"/> hym. Mayſter care not for nothyng for I ſhall ſerue you wel of al thing that ye need by the grace of god, and ſee that ye werke as faſte as ye can for I ſhall bringe you more ſtones and morter my ſelfe alone than yee ſhall con occupye; but ye haſte you well. And whan the mayſter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon heard Reynawde ſpeake thus: he was merueyled and ſayd. By my ſoule freende yf ye doo halfe that yee ſay: ye ſhall doo ynoughe. Then we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Reynawde agayne and brought vp ſo many ſtones that he made with it a great hepe vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles ynough for to occupye at ones all the maſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that were there, and than Reynawde ſayde to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Fayre mayſters thinke to werke wel, for whan theſe ſtones ben layde and this morter occupyed I ſhall brynge you more. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the maſons heard him ſpeke ſo: they began to ſay amonge them that the churche of ſaynt Peter had founde a good labourer, &amp; that he ought to be well rewarded, By my fayth may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſayde Reynawde I care not for no money. And whan came at euyn y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the laborers ſhould leaue werke &amp; receyue theyr money: the Mayſter Maſon ſet him downe for to paye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> labourers, which tooke .v. penis a day. Than the mayſter called Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde and ſayde to hym, come hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my fayre freende and take heere what it pleſe you, for ye haue ſerued better than any of thother, than put himſelf forth, &amp; tooke a peny ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt his wyl. And whan the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaw that: he ſayde to hym, by the bodi of God my fayre freend ye ſhal haue twenty more for els my conſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence ſhould be charged wyth your labour, and yf ye wyl werke: ye ſhal euery daye haue ſo muche, for there was neuer ſo good a labourer as ye be one, Mayſter ſayde Reynawde yf ye wyl that I ſhal werke any more: giue me but one peny, whyche ſhall be for to bye bread for to ſuſteyne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all my body, for this that I doo: I doo it for the loue of God &amp; for none other. Freende ſayde the Mayſter, I wyll not trouble you no more, doo as ye wyll. Than tooke Reynawde leue of the mayſter Maſon and went to the towne for to get hymſelf a lod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynge and bought a penye worthe of bread, and ſo had he no more to his ſupper but bread and a litle water.</p>
            <p>And whan he had eaten: he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and layed hym vpon a lytle ſtrawe for to take his reſt that nyght, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day was come: Reynawd roſe vp and went to hys worke and founde no body there, and than he went to the Churche and ſayd his prayers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an ymage of our Ladye. This hangyng: the Maſons came for to goe to theyr worke. And whan they were vpon the walle: they aſked yf the ſtronge man were not com. May<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter anſwered Reynawde I am heere wyll ye any thyng? Freend ſayd tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mayſter Maſon, bring vs ſtones and morter. Syr ſayd Reynawde I ſhall wyth a good wyll and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Than ſet he ſtones and morter in great plentie, and brought it vp vnto them. And I promyſe you that Reynawde laded more at ones than xv. other dyd, and thus ſerued Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawde
<pb facs="tcp:7017:176"/> the maſons in the churche of ſaynt Peter at Coleyn many dayes and euery day at euyn he tooke hys peny of the mayſter and no more for to by hym bread w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as ye haue heard for he eate neuer but bread &amp; dranke water. Thus liued Reynawde there a longe whyle ſeruing there the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as it is ſayd, for the loue of god and of ſaynt Peter, and dyd ſo truly his deuoyr that the other labourers had great enuy at him, for they were all ſet at nought (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of hym) of the maſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for the great ſeruyce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did to them. Sore an angred were the other labourers whan they ſaw that they were all thus forſaken &amp; all ſet a ſyde and ſayde to eche other in this wyſe. By god we be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diffamed by thys greate knaue that dothe ſo muche labour, and therfore wee be put a ſide of the mayſters, the greate deuyll brought hym well heere, for we ſhall neuer get nothyng as long as he is heere, for he ſerueth all the Maſons alone of all that they need for to haue &amp; thus we ben left alone.</p>
            <p>Then ſayd one of them, my felowes yf ye wyl beleue me: we ſhal ſlea him How ſay ye that ſayde a nother? ye wot well it is impoſſyble to vs to doo ſo, for he is horrible ſtronge, and yf we fet vpon hym: he ſhall kyll vs all. Freende ſayd he I ſhall tell you how we ſhal doo ſo. Se you yonder vawte by the great houſe? Yea ſayd thother. Wit it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great knaue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth &amp; ſlepeth there euery night whan we ar gone home. And therfore yf ye wil beleue me: We ſhal go this night there where he is a ſlepe, and we ſhal take eche of vs a Pikeaxe, or els an hamer, and therwith we ſhall daſſhe the brayne out of his head, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue thus ſlayne hym: wee ſhall put hym in a greate ſacke and ſhall caſt him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the riuer, that is there nyghe, &amp; thus ſhalbe no more hearde of hym. And whan the other labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers heard this traytour ſpeake thei accorded all to his counſel, and they dyd as they were purpoſed ſoner than they wende they ſhould haue doo. For at noone whan the Maſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s left worke and went to theyr dinner: the poore Reynawd went and reſted hymſelfe vnder the vawte, where he was wont to reſt hymſelfe euerye nyght. And whan the traytours ſaw that: they came to him that fyrſt had ſpoken the treaſon and tooke hym a great hamer of a maſon in hys ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. And whan they ſpyed that Reynawd was fallen a ſleape: thys traytour wyth the hamer went to Reynawde ſoftlye and ſmote hym with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer well deepe into the brayne. And whan Reynawde felte the ſtroke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the traytour had gyuen hym: he ſet his armes in maner of a croſſe vpon his breſt and ſayd in this maner. O good lorde Ieſu Chryſt haue mercye on my ſoule, and wyll pardon them that hath brought me to my death, and whan he had ſayd theſe wordes: the ſoule departed out of the bodye. And whan the traytour had thus ſlayne Reynawde: they put hym in to a great ſacke that they had ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therfore, and than they laded the cart wherin they brought the ſtones with the body of hym, and ſo caryed
<pb n="Clxxi" facs="tcp:7017:176"/> hym into the ryuer of Ryne, wherin they caſt him, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had doone ſo: they laded the carte with ſtones &amp; brought them to the church worke as they were wont to doo, &amp; as they were by the way: they met the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter maſon, that ſayd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By my fayth galantes I con you now tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke for ye mende your ſelfe. For ye haue doone great diligence ſyth dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that ye haue laden ſo many ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that ye ben ſo ferre wyth them to the worke warde. Mayſter ſayd the traytours mocke not wyth vs ſo, but go to your purſe and giue vs ſome drynkyng money.</p>
            <p>SOre meruayled was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that he ſaw his labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers more dilygent than they were accuſtumed. Than the labourers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſay to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mayſter of the worke by maner of a mocke, where is that great lurden that he helpeth not now I holde hym gone without leue, by cauſe he might not labour no le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, for we heard ſay that he ſhould neuer ceaſſe tyll he had founde hys wyfe agayne. And whan the mayſter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon heard that: he was ſory and ſaid to them agayne. By my fayth I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that ye haue chaſed hym away, but I promyſe you yf I can wyt that ye haue doone ſo: it were better for you that ye were at Iheruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſayd the labourers ye may well ſay to vs what ye wyll, but we dyd neuer ſay ought to him that ſhoulde diſpleaſe hym. And whan the noble Reynawde was thus caſte into the ryuer of Ryne by the labourers of the churche of ſaynt Peter: ye muſt wyt that he went not to the botome of the water, but went harde aboue the water a longe the ſtreme. And at that: our Lorde ſhewed for hym a fayre myracle. For all the fyſſhe of the ryuer gathered them aboute the corps, and by the ſtrength of the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes it was taried, and went no fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſtreme by the wyll of our lorde. And the great fyſſhes put theymſelf vnder hym and bare hym vpon the water ſo that he apered to euery mans ſyght. And there the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes bare him ſo vp vnto night. And whan the night was come: apered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the corps a great quantytie of torches by the vertue of our lorde, &amp; aungelles that ſonge there ſo melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyouſly: that they that heard it wolde neuer haue gone fro it. And to ſaye trouth there was ſo greate lyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the corps that all they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſawe it wende that all the water of the Ryne had be a fyre. And whan the folke of the citie ſaw ſo great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: they ran all thyther bothe men and women and children. And alſo the archebiſſhop of ſaynt Peter we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> thyther with al his college in a fayre proceſſyon, ſyngyng by great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and taryed vpon the Ryne, for they durſte not goe no ferther, and they ſaw the fiſſhes that bare vp the Corps aboue the water. And whan they that were there ſaw that: they were abaſſhed &amp; meruayled greatlye what it might be, and began to ſaye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one to the other. God what mai he be, for whome our lorde ſheweth ſo fayre a myracle? Lordes ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſhop.
<pb facs="tcp:7017:177"/> I ſhall tell you as myne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe giueth me. Wyt it that it is the bodye of ſome ſaynt that our Lorde wyll haue worſhypped that is come heere from ſom where, whiche God wyl not that he be loſt, nor drowned in the water. See ye not how the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes holde hym aboue the water, by the vertue of our lorde. Than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop commaunded that men ſhould go ſee what it was, and anon folke went there w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> botes, &amp; they founde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the great man that was one of the labourers with the maſons in the churche of ſaynt Peter. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mayſter of the worke ſawe this: he was greatly abaſſhed, and went to them that had ſlayne hym, &amp; ſayd to them in thys maner of wyſe. Ye horeſons falſe traytours, ye haue ſlayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good man, ſay ye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouth, for if ye deny it: I ſhal proue it vpon you. And whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> labourers heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſter maſon ſpeke thus: they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to crye, and ſayd. By God mayſter, we haue doone it without doubt for enuy that we had at hym. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs be drowned, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged or dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, or what iuſtice ye wyll. For we haue well deſerued for to be punyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And whan the archebyſſhop hearde the traytours ſpeake ſo: he began for to weepe ful tenderly, and al his colege alſo. And the archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was counſelled that he ſhould let go the murderers at theyr auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for to do penaunce for theyr ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the whiche thynge the archebyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop dyd wyth a good wyll. Than was the body of Reynawde brought to lande, and was put vpon a carte for to beare hym to the church, wher as he was had worſhypfully wyth fayre proceſſion. And whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corps was in the church: the archebyſſhop made him redy for to ſyng the maſſe by great deuocion. And whan that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice was doone: the archebyſſhop wolde haue gone a proceſſyon with the corps aboute the churche, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded foure lordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there that they ſhould bere the corps. And than the barons wolde haue doone hys commaundement, but whan they came therto: they coulde not moue the corps by no ſtrength that they could put therto. Sore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled were the barons, whan they ſaw that, and ſayd vnto eche other. Now may we well knowe that we be not worthy for to touche this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corps. For we be wicked ſynners wherfore let vs go for to ſhriue vs &amp; put our ſelfe in good eſtate. And while that they ſpake thus together: the corps roſe vp of hym ſelfe, and was borne, no man knoweth howe out of the churche into the carte, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che anon moued and went his way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſtreyght out of the citie, wherof they were al greatly meruayled, and whan the carte was out of Coleyne: he went a pace all the hye waye. And whan the people ſaw that: they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all to wepe bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corps wolde not abyde. Than ſayd the archebyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop vnto them. Syrs now may ye well ſee that this is a holy corps by the great myracles that our Lorde ſheweth by him now, and al this day afore vs all. Wherfore let vs goe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him for to worſhip him. For it
<pb n="clxxii" facs="tcp:7017:177"/> were not very well doone for to let hym go thus alone. My lorde ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, ye ſay wel, &amp; than al the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and al the comyn people litle and great that myght go: folowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ps. And ye ought to wit that in all the citie of Coleyn abode nother ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor woman, but went with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corps and all the clergy folowed after ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng in great deuocion. So muche went the carte that he came to a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towne that is called Croyne, and there he abode ſtyll. And ye muſt wit that our lorde dyd ſhew there many fayre myracles for the loue of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body, for al ſycke people of what ſyckenes it was that came there for to worſhyp the holye bodye: Were whole incontinent. This happed of the noble knight Reynawde of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tawban, as ye haue hearde. And ye ought to wyt that the renome of the holy body was ſo ſpred all aboute, that folke came to Croyne where it abode from ferre wayes for to ſeeke hym, and he made there ſo fayre my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: that of all the Realme and of almayne folke drewe thether. And ſo muche were worthe the offringes that were done there within a ſhort while: that of a litle chapell there as the bodye reſted, whiche was of our lady, is now a royall churche and a great. And whan the holy body was abyden in this lytle chapell as it is ſayd, where god made contynually miracles: the archebyſſhop of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn &amp; al the clergi came to the corps &amp; vncouered his viſage that euerye body ſhould ſee him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came there, yf haply y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ony man or woman myght know hym for to haue his name, for none coulde name hym, but the holy corps. But there came no man that could know. And whan the archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no body could ſay what he was: he was ſory for it, for yf he had knowen his name: he wold haue put him in a ſhrine of golde, bicauſe of the great miracles that he made dayly, for he made the defe to heare, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blynde to ſee, the lame to go &amp; ryght many that were dombe he made to ſpeake, &amp; often times apered tapres of wexe brennyng aboute the corps.</p>
            <p>NOw ſhall ye heare howe the noble Reynawde was kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. Yee ought to wyt that the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern of Reynawde, that is to wyt Alarde, Guicharde &amp; Richarde were on a daye vpon mountayne ſo ſorye that they could heare no tidinges of theyr brother Reynawde. Than cam a Pylgrime forth by that ſalued the barons. Pylgrime ſayde Alarde, fro whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s come ye? yf ye wot any tydin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges tel it vs I pray you. Lordes ſaid the pilgrime w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a good wyll I ſhall tell you that I know. Wyt it that I come out of Almaine, from a towne that is called Croyne by Coleyne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ryne, where I haue ſeen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great miracles doone of god, for the loue of a man that came to the Citie but late ago, the which was ſo great that euery body ſaid there that he was a Giaunte. And wyt ye that whan he came there: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſawe men make the churche of ſaynt Peter, ſo dyd he preſent there hys ſeruyce to the mayſter maſon, the whiche retey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:7017:178"/> hym gladly. Shortly for to ſay: this great man dyd wonder of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of ſtones and of morter. For he bare more at ones: than .xv. other of the labourers that were there with him, and he was all day w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out meate ſaue at euyn: he tooke a peny that he gate, for no more he wolde haue for hys laboure a day, and therwyth he bought hym a peny loſe, and dranke none other to it, but water, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went to his reſt vpon a litle ſtraw vnder a great vaute. And ye muſte wyt, that this great man was well loued of the mayſters maſons of the ſayd churche, whyche wolde often haue gyuen him meate and wyne, &amp; more money. But he wolde neuer take nothyng but a peny onely by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day, for to bye hym ſelfe a peny lofe as I told you afore. He ſerued ſo wel all the maſons there that they were more contente of hym alone: then of the other labourers. And whan the labourers ſaw that they were ſo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſet by for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of this great ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they were ſore an angred, and tooke great enuy at hym and conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther for to ſlea hym ſhamefully.</p>
            <p>So dyd they aſpye hym where as he ſlept vnder the vaute, whyle that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mayſter maſons were gone to theyr dyner: and then one of theym came to hym with great hamer in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and brayned him, then they put hym in a ſacke and caryed him in a carte to the Ryuer of the Ryne, where they caſt hym. And wyt it that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had doone ſo: our lorde ſhewed there a great myracle. For al the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of the Ryne aſſembled them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the corps, and made it abyde in one place aboue the water. And whan that the nyght was come: aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles were hearde there, whyche ſonge melodiouſly the ſeruyce of the dead ſo hye: that all they of the Citie might haue heard them, and it ſemed that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water about hym had ben in a fyre of the greate lyght that was ſeen there. Than came the archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Coleyne wyth all his colege and made the corps to be taken and brought in a Carte to the Churche. And whan he was there: the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſhop ſonge maſſe, for this was in the mornyng, and whan that the ſeruyce was doone: the Achebyſſhop ſayd to foure Lordes whyche were there, that they ſhould take vp the corps for to haue him into his graue wyth fayre proſeſſyon. But theſe foure barons coulde neuer moue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where as he was. But the corps incontynent to euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſight, that was there, was brou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ght into the carte agayne, wyth the twynkelyng of an eye, and ſodeynly the carte departed, and wente away alone out of the towne, as good a pace as thoughe ten horſes had dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen at it, whyche was ſore agaynſt the wyll of the people that wept ful tenderly, bycauſe that it wolde not a byde with them. But all they of the Cytye, bothe lytle and great went a proceſſyon after it, vnto a lytle town where the corps of the great man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode ſtyll whyche is called Croyne in a lytle chapell of our lady, where he doth now many a fayre myracle, for I enſure you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the ſicke folkes
<pb n="clxxii" facs="tcp:7017:178"/> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeeke him there be made whole, &amp; returne to their home in good helth. And ſo I haue left there the archebiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop of Coleyne, and all the clergye that hath doo make of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offerynges that ben gyuen there vnto thys holy corps a fayre place and a roial chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, there as the ſayd chapell of oure lady was afore.</p>
            <p>WHan Alarde, Guicharde and Rycharde, heard the pilgry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſpeake ſo: they began all three to weepe ful ſore for pitie that they had of theyr brother reynawde, for well they knew, it was he of whome the Pylgryme ſpake of. Alas my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſayd Rycharde. Now ben w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> well deſtroyed, and vndoone for euer more. For I know wel that it is out deere brother that we haue ſought ſo longe. Wyt it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the three brethern made there ſo great ſorowe, that it cannot be reherſed. And whan they had made this greate ſorowe: they tooke leaue of the pilgrime and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And lyghted before the churche they and theyr folke, where they found ſo great flowyng and gatheryng of the people and ſo great preſe of folke: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyth great payne they myght entre wythin the Churche. And whan the knyghtes were within: they wente nyghe the holye corps that was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a fayre bere all vncouered, and ſaw ſo great lyght aboute the corps as there had ben an hundred torches Than wente they as nyghe hym as they coulde for to looke hym in the face and anon thei knew that he was theyr brother, &amp; with that they loked vpon hym: they fell downe in a ſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une to the erth. And whan the arche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>byſſhop ſaw that: he was ſore abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſayd to ſome of his Colege. Syrs I beleue that wee ſhall ſoone know that we haue deſyred ſo long. For I wene that theſe lordes knowe wel this holy corps. This hanging: were the three brethern come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agayn to themſelfe, and began to crye and fare as they had ben mad, than ſayd Alarde al weepynge in thys maner, Alas what ſhall we nowe caytyfes knyghtes doo, poore of honour and of al wele, ſyth that we haue loſt our brother by whome we were ſo ſore doubted and dred? Alas deere brother who was ſo hardy to laye hande on you? I beleue that he knew not your debonayrtie &amp; kindnes, for he wolde not haue ſlayne you ſo crueltye. And than he turned hym towarde hys two brethern and ſayd. My fayre bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thern we ought wel to be ſory, ſyth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue loſt our brother Reinawde that was all our hope our truſt and comfort. Alas ſayde Rycharde, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reinawde whi had ye euer that courage for to habandone vs as ye did: ſeyng that ye loued vs ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che? Alas ye ſtale awaye yourſelf by night, for to come amonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handes of the murderers, that haue ſlayne you ſo cruelly. Alas they wyſt not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great domage that is of your death.
<pb facs="tcp:7017:179"/> whan the three brethern had wepte ynoughe in great ſobbynges and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentacions, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of theyr deere brother Reynawde: they went &amp; kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the corps on the mouth, the one after the other, and with this thei fel downe agayne in ſwoune. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were come agayn to themſelfe: Rycharde began to crye and ſaye. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las fayre brethern, now ben we loſte for euer. For we ſhall no more be ſet by, nother doubted, nor dred more than children, wherefore I ſay that we ſhould ſlea our ſelfe, to the ende that we may be with you, for we ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght not to liue after your death. Wit it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who had be there he ſhould haue had an harde hert but he ſhould haue wept for to ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three brethern make theyr mone.</p>
            <p>WHan the archebiſhop and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Burgeys that were there ſaw the great ſorowe that the three knightes made: the good Archebyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop came to them and ſayd, Lordes be ye not dyſpleaſed of that I ſhall ſay to you. Syrs to my ſemynge, ye doo not wel for to make ſo great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row nor to diſcomfort your ſelfe ſo muche as ye do, but rather ye ſhould make great ioy, and be glad for your brother that is a ſaynt in heuen, the whyche had ſuffred martyrdom in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice of our lorde, wherof ye may ſee that he rewardeth him wel for it. For ye ſee now before your eyen the great miracles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he dooth, wherfore I pray you that ye wyll recomforte your ſelfe. And tell vs yf it pleaſe you what ye ben, and howe is thys holy body named, and what hys na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me was wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he liued in this worlde to the ende that his name be wryten aboute his tombe? And whan his bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thern heard the archebyſſhop ſpeake thus: they began a lytle to leue theyr ſorow. And than Alarde that was theldeſt after Reynawde ſayd to him Lorde ſythe it pleaſe you to knowe what we be and howe this corps is called: I ſhall tel it you w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out faute. Ye muſte wyt that this corps was called (whan he was amonge vs ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue) Reynawde of Mountawban the ryght worthy knyght, and we three that ben heere are his brethern, and wel I wot that ye haue heard ſpeake of the foure ſonnes of Aymon, the whiche Charlemayne the great king of Fraunce warred ſo longe. Than whan the archebyſſhop and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hearde that they were the foure ſonnes of Aymon, of the whyche all the worlde ſpake, and that the holy corps was the goood Reynawde of Mountawba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the noble and valiant knight: they began all to weepe for pitie and for ioye, bycauſe they ſawe al before them the moſte noble &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thieſt knyght of the worlde, that in his lyfe was more to drede than any man alyue, that was dead in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyſe of our lorde, doinge penaunce. After that theſe three bretherne had thus left a lytle theyr ſorowe: they made theyr brother to be layde in his tombe, that was right riche, that the archebiſſhop had doone make where the holy corps reſteth yet at this day as euydently is knowen, and he is called ſaynt Reynawde the martyr.
<pb n="Clxxiiii" facs="tcp:7017:179"/> The memory of him was that time put in wrytyng auctentykly, &amp; eueri yere is there kept for him great ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie and feaſt.
